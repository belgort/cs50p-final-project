# Clickable Recording Transcript

00:00:00 Now that Gerry is here telling us on Jerry Jones, we hit the record button.
)

00:00:05 So I wanted to do. Yeah, I just wanted to share something totally unrelated to code, right?
)

00:00:10 But you know, you're all sitting on on on Zoom, right?
)

00:00:13 And I'm sitting here and you see, you know, me coding, talking, whatever it may be, but I wanted to share with you how blown up my screen is.
)

00:00:25 Can you see that? Yeah, so that's that's me teaching to you.
)

00:00:32 But right when you when you see it from your end, kind of here, let's get rid of it.
)

00:00:38 Come on this. That's what you see. All right.
)

00:00:43 So I just thought I'd share that because Zoom, right, does a really good job of allowing me to zoom in my screen, right?
)

00:00:52 And allow you to see, like I said, just the normal view.
)

00:00:57 So, yeah, and that's that's why you never want to allow me to drive a car, right?
)

00:01:04 Because I I'm like, I don't know. There used to be a kids cartoon called Mister Mr Magoo.
)

00:01:12 I don't know that it remembers that, but he he was a character that drove around and he couldn't see.
)

00:01:19 So thankfully, my wife read it. Yeah, I remember this and go, Yeah.
)

00:01:25 So yeah, thankfully, my wife and, you know, friends, you know, drive, drive me around.
)

00:01:32 All right. So let's get started. Let's get started. We're in.
)

00:01:36 We're nearing the end. This is the last module. This is like the last like full module on on something called classes, the finding classes,
)

00:01:47 which you've already done using the graphics library, but you didn't know much about it other than, Hey, here's I want to.
)

00:01:54 I want a graphics window. I want to circle. I want all all these things.
)

00:01:59 But how can we like develop those types of things on our on our own right?
)

00:02:05 So that's what this module is all about. This is the last problem set.
)

00:02:09 This is the last learning guide. Clear. This is the last written quiz.
)

00:02:14 And next Monday. I don't think we'll have class because it's Thanksgiving week.
)

00:02:20 There won't be any need on. Some of you wanted to take the Microsoft Python certification.
)

00:02:30 So there is a schedule and canvas under the Microsoft MTA section, and there's a couple of things in there that's wanted to share with you.
)

00:02:40 OK? Number one is you need to schedule your exam time with me, either from Monday, December six or Friday, December 10th.
)

00:02:50 And some of you have done that already, and I appreciate that. I recommend that you take the exam on Monday this way if you don't pass it.
)

00:03:02 And I've failed quite a few of these in my time, a fewer.
)

00:03:08 So you'll be able to retake it on Friday if you don't pass it.
)

00:03:12 All right. Just say it. So we give you two opportunities to take it.
)

00:03:17 So here is the information right here. You all should have access to it.
)

00:03:23 I want you to schedule your your exam with me and bye bye.
)

00:03:29 If you have an inkling to take any of these other Microsoft certification exams,
)

00:03:36 there is one on C-sharp and I know we have a c sharp programmer in the class here.
)

00:03:41 So just note that not only can you take Python, but you can schedule all these others to and I'd be happy to provide them to you.
)

00:03:49 Practice them for you in person a class on either Monday, December six or Friday, December 10.
)

00:03:56 No cost to you. Just just know that these are free.
)

00:04:00 There is no cost to you. So what you need to do is you need to like, like email me and say, Hey Bruce,
)

00:04:07 I want to schedule h html on Monday night and I want to schedule a python at one o'clock, you know, just just like that.
)

00:04:16 All right, here's the instructions. It's all right here, right?
)

00:04:22 And the next thing you want to do is I've some of you may have used this before, but we have access to practice tests.
)

00:04:31 It's called G Metrics. They're the name of the company that makes it.
)

00:04:35 So if you go through all these steps here, right,
)

00:04:39 and you enter this magical code right here and select the Microsoft and then Python or whatever exam you want to study for,
)

00:04:50 you'll be able to get to practice exams so you can do these practice exams and in practice mode where you get to see the answer after each question.
)

00:05:00 Or you can go in a full on simulation mode where it's timed right and and stuff like that, right?
)

00:05:08 So again, I provide you with the resources. Usually everyone who takes us passes it.
)

00:05:15 Is it 100 percent of the material that I taught? You know, is it 90 percent?
)

00:05:22 Yeah. Is the other 10 percent of the knowledge that you would need to know in some of these key metrics practice exams?
)

00:05:30 Heck, yeah. All right. So that's why everyone usually passed it.
)

00:05:34 And just so, you know, write these things, and I think you all know the story, right?
)

00:05:40 If you go into. Go back to like the beginning of time here with module zero.
)

00:05:47 I think I had like information about me and I've taken.
)

00:05:51 All these various Microsoft certifications over time since I started it, Clark, I mean, I should know all this stuff because I teach a lot of it,
)

00:06:00 but the ones that I did fail are ones that I don't have much experience with, which is like the Java programing language.
)

00:06:08 That's the one I that kicked my butt a lot. So I had to learn Java, you know, over two months, and I finally, I finally passed it.
)

00:06:17 And when you have these things, they also go on your LinkedIn and you know, and you can put them on your portfolio or wherever it may be.
)

00:06:26 And I've said this before, every day I'll get a job request through LinkedIn for especially Python because it's such an in-demand language right now.
)

00:06:38 And the other thing too, is LinkedIn has a little certification exam that you can take to prove your skills.
)

00:06:46 And it was hard. Yeah, I wouldn't go take it right away because you can only take it twice within a six months time and after that, you have to wait.
)

00:06:56 All right. So that's it on certifications, you know, are they required?
)

00:07:01 No. Are they helpful? Yes. Are they good to have?
)

00:07:06 Yeah. All right. Any questions before we get started?
)

00:07:12 Any, any thing, anyone have any questions that I can answer.
)

00:07:23 Nothing in the chat. All right. And for those of you who did send me the code words for the announcement that
)

00:07:32 came out yesterday about watching that video or those videos before class?
)

00:07:38 Thanks. Thanks for doing that. I think I got for people who replied back, So cool.
)

00:07:43 And let's get started. If there's no questions, so let's get started and you can all see my screen right?
)

00:07:50 Just checking, right? Yeah, you can see it. All right. Thanks, Brandon.
)

00:07:55 So let's start off. Let's start off. Let me just call it the demo.
)

00:08:01 Demo Dash one dot pi. OK, just like that. And let's.
)

00:08:08 Pretend, well, let's pretend this is kind of those of you who watch the video, this is kind of what we're going to do.
)

00:08:16 Let's pretend I keep saying it. Let's create some code where we can model a physical dye, a dye that you use for playing board games,
)

00:08:31 whether it's a six sided dye or a hundreds thousands sided dye or a, you know, a 20 sided dye.
)

00:08:38 I don't know what the gamers. I know my son.
)

00:08:42 My son has this big dye with all. I don't know what game it is. Maybe you can tell me,
)

00:08:47 but let's say we wanted to create a template where we could create a dye and then maybe we can create 10000 dye and we could roll them.
)

00:09:02 We could do anything we wanted to do with the dye.
)

00:09:05 Typically, it's you roll the dye, and that's kind of about it, right?
)

00:09:10 So how would we go about creating a piece of software?
)

00:09:17 Something called a class, a class or a template to model a multi-sided DI.
)

00:09:27 OK, so let's do it. We're going to learn a new keyword in Python.
)

00:09:32 And the key word is class. Class Class C L a ss all lowercase.
)

00:09:39 And now you're going. Do you remember with the graphics library when you had like circle, it was uppercase, right?
)

00:09:45 When you had graph, when it was uppercase, right when you had rectangle or polygon?
)

00:09:51 Right. They all started with a capital letter. And that's when you define a class A template you or a blueprint.
)

00:10:00 Right? You use a capital letter. So let's create a a class name called DI.
)

00:10:07 No parentheses. None of that. And just a colon.
)

00:10:11 Just like that. OK. Just like that.
)

00:10:15 So we're going to create a template, a cookie cutter that we're going to use to to fabricate die.
)

00:10:25 This right in software in Python. OK, so here we go.
)

00:10:30 I hit enter and it's like, it's like, All right.
)

00:10:36 What goes inside of here, what goes inside of our class?
)

00:10:40 Well, a whole bunch of things, right? A whole bunch of things.
)

00:10:43 But when you created a graphics window, when you created a circle and you created a rectangle, a polygon.
)

00:10:50 Any of these things? As soon as you created them?
)

00:10:54 Right. Those are what we call.
)

00:10:58 We instantiated them, right? We we we fabricated that right.
)

00:11:02 So with a dye right with a dye?
)

00:11:06 Does anyone want to tell me when we say, go to make a dye, make believe we have a factory in Vancouver here and we may die, right?
)

00:11:16 So what are some properties of a dye?
)

00:11:21 Anyone want to just belt some out to me?
)

00:11:24 What are some things that when I look at it, dye, right?
)

00:11:29 What can you describe some of its properties, right? I have brown hair looks gray, right?
)

00:11:34 I'm five foot nine hundred ninety five pounds.
)

00:11:38 Those are some properties right about Bruce, right? So what are some properties of a dye?
)

00:11:44 Anybody. How many sides? It has number of sides, Common says.
)

00:11:49 I'll I'll take that. So let me just do this.
)

00:11:55 Uh, properties properties. OK, so the first thing is, no, actually, I'm not going to use my triple two three doing.
)

00:12:06 Oops. Number of side. I have a plug in that extension that I need to turn off.
)

00:12:13 Please hold. Please hold. I just turn this on doc.
)

00:12:22 Pi. Can anyone see Python? Doc stream, yeah, I want to turn this off, although I could disable.
)

00:12:30 Sorry about that reload. OK, so here we go.
)

00:12:36 Number of signs. Properties, OK, what else, what else?
)

00:12:43 Collins, right? Number of sites.
)

00:12:45 Let's say you go to Fred Meyer and you buy or you go to the bat cave and you buy some dye and they're in a package, right?
)

00:12:54 What do you see? What do you see when you look at that, that set of dye?
)

00:12:59 What do you see anybody the same shape? OK, well, we'll leave that for now.
)

00:13:06 OK, shape, Jojo says. What else? OK, what about the bears?
)

00:13:11 Usually? OK, so they're packaged in pairs.
)

00:13:14 But tell me about one day, Joshua. Tell me about one guy. Tell me about one guy when you look at it, right?
)

00:13:21 If you know, how about six sizes depending on the deal you're looking at?
)

00:13:25 Yes, that's right. So that's what Colin said. Number of sides.
)

00:13:29 Let's say you look at the shelf and you see a package of dye, right?
)

00:13:34 When you look at that package of dye, right, you'll notice that they have a certain number of sides.
)

00:13:40 But what else do you see? What else do you see? No, that numbers right.
)

00:13:46 So but those numbers, Gerri correspond to the site or when you look, does each dye, especially when, like when you roll a dye,
)

00:13:57 how many values kind of dye have like during a game, like when you roll the dice,
)

00:14:03 do you look at the side of the dye or do you look at the side facing up?
)

00:14:12 Side face it, when you the side facing off and facing up is labeled a no.
)

00:14:18 So what would you call that? What would you call that that that?
)

00:14:22 Would it be the the the value? What do you call like when I rolled of five, right?
)

00:14:29 If I roll of five, what do you call that? Five? Can we call it value is a technical term for it?
)

00:14:38 We could call it a value because that's that's what you get. All right.
)

00:14:41 So we'll call it a value. I'm going to just not use the shape pronounce just because I'll take it a little while.
)

00:14:48 But is it fair to say that the dye that we need to fabricate has a certain number of sides and it's going to have a value, right?
)

00:15:01 Whether it's what the value is in the package, when Jerry is looking at it on the shelf,
)

00:15:06 or it's when Ben is using it to play a game with with his friends, right?
)

00:15:12 We could also add in here color. Right? The dye has a certain color, right?
)

00:15:18 Maybe. I don't know. I don't think that's necessary right now. Let's just stick with we make dye that have a certain number of sides.
)

00:15:27 And when we either package them in, you know,
)

00:15:31 a box or whatever that there is either a value showing on the dye or when Ben uses them in his game, they they have a value.
)

00:15:42 So those two things are the same.
)

00:15:44 So how do we create in the software a dye that has, I don't know, six sides will go with four now and has a default value.
)

00:15:56 Let's just say we have that single dot when we package our dye in our factory in Vancouver,
)

00:16:02 all the dye are placed in the packaging the same way, with the number one showing by default.
)

00:16:10 OK. Let's just go with with that for now. So again, how do we construct this dye in software?
)

00:16:17 Well, there is something we need to do.
)

00:16:21 And you remember from last week when we created these functions,
)

00:16:27 we are going to create a special type of function called a constructor constructor function,
)

00:16:34 which gets run ran when we create a new dye in our software.
)

00:16:42 OK. So what we do is we create a special name called Double actually what this is called.
)

00:16:50 Let me just do this right here. And then just like that.
)

00:16:54 Now this is weird, OK? This is really weird. It's a reserve word in Python, and it it's two underscores the word init,
)

00:17:05 which stands for initialize and then two more underscores and then a set of parentheses I'll call in.
)

00:17:14 OK. And we usually say for these double underscore, as we'll say, Dunder Dundar, not Dunder Mifflin Dunder double underscore.
)

00:17:25 And what this says is when you create, when you construct, when you initialize a new dye, we need to do the following.
)

00:17:35 OK, so check it out. We put this word in here called self.
)

00:17:40 And remember, we're dealing with objects. They have the ability to to know things about them, and they can also do things.
)

00:17:50 So our dye, when we create it, it's going to say, Hey, self.
)

00:17:56 OK, what's your value? What what's your value and what's your number of sites?
)

00:18:03 So now we're going to say, Hey, self. What's your value and let's set all of our die to have a default value of one?
)

00:18:12 OK. Now again, I know some of this is highly, you know, just way out in left field right now, but just stick with me.
)

00:18:21 So by default, when we create a new die or a new object or a new template, right, which we're doing here or by a class may just fix us up here.
)

00:18:31 We say we create the class name, right?
)

00:18:37 I called it die uppercase.
)

00:18:40 We create our constructor function, constructor function and this get run as soon as we create a new die, which we haven't done yet.
)

00:18:50 We're just creating the template for what happens when we create a new die, just like we did with a new graph when a new circle, a new rectangle.
)

00:19:00 It had a constructor which said, Hey, when when you let me carry on.
)

00:19:05 So when we create the die, we're setting itself to have a value one and we're setting the number of sides to six.
)

00:19:14 We're going to stick with a six sided die. OK, so believe it or not, believe it or not,
)

00:19:21 what we've done here is we have created a template to make six sided die that have a default value of one.
)

00:19:33 OK, now. Just take that in for a second.
)

00:19:37 Okay, take that in, and it'll make a lot more sense as soon as I construct my first day.
)

00:19:43 Can I check it? Here we go.
)

00:19:48 Here we go. Let's just call it die one variable name.
)

00:19:52 Die one. Just like you did with Circle, you created Circle one, Circle two or i1 I two, right?
)

00:19:58 I just call them create a variable called die one. And I said, Hey, die one.
)

00:20:03 I want you to create a new die. Just like that. Just create a new die, just like we did with graph one and other things.
)

00:20:11 There is no parameters yet for our die.
)

00:20:15 We're just if you create a die, just like I did here, we're saying, Hey, hey, hey, class,
)

00:20:21 create a new die that has a default value of one and six sides and store it in this variable called die one by one.
)

00:20:32 Now everyone's like, All right, if I print out the type of die one, do you think it's going to be a a string?
)

00:20:41 Be an integer or c an object on a integer B string C object?
)

00:20:51 What do you think? Line 13 is going to print out.
)

00:20:56 Take a there's no wrong guesses here. Somebody take a guess. Object, I mean, string, an integer string or object.
)

00:21:05 I think in strength. So, Jojo, to your point.
)

00:21:11 We have won a default value of one.
)

00:21:15 That's that's that little snake eyes staring at us in on the dye and the dye has six sides.
)

00:21:22 So could we represent both these bits of information as a string?
)

00:21:28 Or is it like when we created a circle, the circle had a center point and the circle had a radius,
)

00:21:38 so which was an object, so integer string or object?
)

00:21:45 You're going to stick with your answer, Joshua, what do you want to change it? You want to buy a vowel?
)

00:21:57 Everybody I didn't think about. All right.
)

00:22:00 So when we created a circle was a circle, an integer, a string or an object.
)

00:22:09 And I just want to know it's an object, right? It's an object, so we're doing the same thing.
)

00:22:15 We've created our own object that we made right here, right?
)

00:22:22 And if I print out, it's tight. It says, in fact, that it is made.
)

00:22:31 Of a die, so this believe it or not, this is telling you that this variable die one is an object and in fact it is.
)

00:22:41 It is a die. It is a die, which is which is an object.
)

00:22:45 It's not a string. It's not an integer, right?
)

00:22:48 It's an object. Because Jojo, check it out.
)

00:22:52 I can then say print die one dot, just like we did with the graphics library.
)

00:22:59 And look what we get here size and value. So let's just do sides.
)

00:23:05 And now we're going to print out right sides. Sides is a prop.
)

00:23:12 Remember when we did like? I'm trying to remember an example where we just used a property like this, but let me just run it so you can see it.
)

00:23:24 And now it's telling me that that dye that we created has six signs that Dye one has six sides and that dye one has a value its current value looks.
)

00:23:41 I can't type today. Its value is going to be.
)

00:23:46 One. Okay, now we've created a model of a die in software, now we've created one die with it for our program to use.
)

00:23:56 But if we want to create a second, die a second, die here, I'm just going to copy this code, copy this code.
)

00:24:04 Put it here and change die one to die to.
)

00:24:14 Right, I mean, just put a print here. Die, too.
)

00:24:19 And I'll print. A. A print die one.
)

00:24:29 So you can see that we've created. Today.
)

00:24:36 Although one second, I think they did it. Here it is.
)

00:24:40 So we've created die one right here. Let me show me sorry, this is a little theaters die one.
)

00:24:48 It's made of a die. It has six sides. The current value is one in the package.
)

00:24:54 Then we have a die to, which is made for a die, has six sides and has a face value of one.
)

00:25:04 So using not really take one. So using this one set of code right here, using this one set of code, I've created two dice.
)

00:25:17 Two dice, right? Two dice. Two dice.
)

00:25:22 I can go on and on and I can create other die using this, but that's not going to be any fun.
)

00:25:29 And when we do things like this, we're having to create variables for each one of those die, which is probably not a good thing.
)

00:25:40 You learned a few weeks ago about list and how a list can be like a bag of dye.
)

00:25:46 It can have multiple dice inside of it. All right.
)

00:25:50 So let's just put this aside for now and let me create another demo that's going to expand on this die a little bit.
)

00:26:01 So I'm going to do control and I'm going to paste in the code.
)

00:26:05 I'm going to save it. I'm going to call it Demo Dash to.
)

00:26:10 Don't. I think. Demo Test two PI.
)

00:26:15 And there's my die. There it is. There is my template to make die.
)

00:26:20 Now this is all well and good. If we just want to be able to create like one die or, you know, a million die.
)

00:26:31 Okay. So what we want to be able to do is to be able to give our guy something that a real die would have.
)

00:26:44 And when you're playing a game, what's the one thing you do with a die?
)

00:26:49 What do you do with it, you? Roll it, you roll it right.
)

00:26:56 So how do we give our die that we're creating?
)

00:27:01 Thanks, Robert. By the way, how do we create a method or a way that our die can do something?
)

00:27:09 And in this case, it's how could we make it so we can roll it via software and by rolling it?
)

00:27:18 What is the one property of that die that's going to change?
)

00:27:23 It's not going to change and morph into having more or less sides.
)

00:27:28 But what's going to be the one thing that changes when after we roll a die anybody?
)

00:27:37 What's going to be under my eyes? Yeah, but what what?
)

00:27:43 That but what what property of that guy gets randomized? What what property on line three or four of my code gets randomized?
)

00:27:55 Which property there? Besides the assures, so when I roll the die, the number of side change or does the value change Jojo?
)

00:28:05 But I guess like the side that you're meeting. So yeah, the the value, right?
)

00:28:12 That's the the the number of facing up, right?
)

00:28:15 So we're playing. Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
)

00:28:19 So what we want to do is we want to define a new method called roll.
)

00:28:25 Let's just call it roll, roll roll. And then we're going to say, Hey, self, hey di you, I'm talking to you.
)

00:28:34 Roll yourself, right? And then I'm going to say, like Jojo said, we need to be able to now generate a random number, right?
)

00:28:47 Because Ben is playing this game and he's writing a software game and he rolls that AI, right?
)

00:28:53 So he's going to say, Hey, software guy that we haven't created in this demo yet.
)

00:28:58 I need you to generate a random number between one and six, because that's the number of sites that you have.
)

00:29:09 So here I go. Ready. I'm going to say, Hey, self.
)

00:29:15 I need you to set your value to. Some random number between one and six.
)

00:29:26 So anyone does anyone realize what functionality we need to bring into our code at this point to help us generate a random number, I hear somebody.
)

00:29:40 We need to import random. Yes, Ben.
)

00:29:44 So Ben is like, Hey, Bruce from the random library from random import rand.
)

00:29:53 Right?
)

00:29:53 Because Rand gives us and we've used this over and over again and write a set of random integers, random whole numbers inclusively between two things.
)

00:30:03 So could we not write do this?
)

00:30:06 Could we say Hey rand and generate a number, generate a number from one to one comma one to the number of sides that this particular guy has?
)

00:30:22 I didn't order code six because I'm saying, Hey di, look at yourself.
)

00:30:26 How many sides do you have? How many sides you have?
)

00:30:30 Look at yourself and the diocese. Oh, I got six.
)

00:30:33 So what it's going to do now is going to generate a random number between one and six and tell itself that that is its new value.
)

00:30:44 Just just like that. OK. Just like that. So what I can do in my code now, I'm out, didn't it all the way?
)

00:30:53 I have my di template and my dye template has two properties, right?
)

00:30:58 These are properties. Let me label these properties right.
)

00:31:04 And this down here is a method, right? Remember the when we took an object in the graphics library and we told it to draw itself, draw is a method.
)

00:31:17 Notice the method. Start with lowercase letters, right?
)

00:31:21 The class name starts with a capital letter, and we're not returning anything.
)

00:31:29 We're just saying, Hey, look at yourself, change the value of yourself from one to the number of sides that you have.
)

00:31:39 So let's go create our die one again. We're going to say die one equals create a new die, just create a new day.
)

00:31:46 And then we're going to say, Hey, die one actually print out, Hey, die one.
)

00:31:51 Print out the number of sides. Print out your value.
)

00:31:56 Print out your value. Tell me what your value is. And by default, that value is one because we haven't told our die to roll itself in code yet.
)

00:32:06 We just fabricated instantiated a new die.
)

00:32:11 So here it is, right down here. It's one we have one as the default value showing in our die when we created it.
)

00:32:21 So now if I say, Hey, die one. Hey, day one, I want you to take yourself and role yourself role as a method role is something that a guy can do.
)

00:32:35 It's not a prop., it's something that a guy can do.
)

00:32:39 And now if I just copy this line of code again, if I copy this line of code again,
)

00:32:46 hey, day one, what is your value after we asked you to roll yourself ready?
)

00:32:52 Let me run it. Do I did I point out there it is.
)

00:32:57 So one in one? Let me run it again. One in six.
)

00:33:03 One in five. One in four. One in six. One in five. One in two.
)

00:33:07 One and one one. And two one in five one in three six.
)

00:33:11 So do you see how we were able to create in the software?
)

00:33:18 A cookie cutter template to create a day when we created it, right?
)

00:33:24 This is a code that gets run when we do this line.
)

00:33:28 12. It gives itself a default value of one and six sides, and then we're asking our dye that we created to roll itself.
)

00:33:43 And we're setting its value that it knows it is, this is what we call an instance variable.
)

00:33:51 It kind of in this instance where we created Die One, it knows what value it's set to and that is one in fixed.
)

00:34:01 OK, but when we roll it, we're changing that value to be some number between one and the number of sides.
)

00:34:12 That particular dye has. What are you thinking about classes so far?
)

00:34:25 What what kind of questions are coming to mind kind of abstract?
)

00:34:29 Is this a very abstract concept? A little bit.
)

00:34:43 And then like. Well, I. Just because you're putting everything into one like what we were doing before, but now it's all into one group.
)

00:34:53 A group. So what Robert's referring to is, Bruce, you have these functions here.
)

00:34:58 Right? One of them has this weird name called Thunder and Thunder, and this other one is a regular one that you kind of recognize.
)

00:35:07 But they're all grouped together under this.
)

00:35:12 Class that is known as die. Right?
)

00:35:15 So, Robert? Yes, to that point.
)

00:35:19 A class is defined of a bunch of functions because again, going back to the graphics library when you created a new rectangle,
)

00:35:29 you could set it fill, you could set its outline, you could clone it.
)

00:35:35 There's a whole bunch of things that a rectangle was able to do,
)

00:35:40 and what we're doing is we're just mimicking that whole concept we learned with objects and the graphics library.
)

00:35:49 By creating our own objects that have properties right and are able to do what we need a thing to do and will do way more of these other than to die.
)

00:36:03 But Robert, does that help a little bit clarifying what's going on?
)

00:36:07 Yeah, it makes sense. But then like around like what?
)

00:36:11 I guess Line 11, would you normally put that in the main two? Yeah.
)

00:36:15 So Ben was Ben was on my shoulder and he's like, Bruce, you should really put that code in the main here.
)

00:36:22 Let me just do that. Is that better?
)

00:36:29 And that makes sense now. Yeah. I'm sorry.
)

00:36:33 Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. So and on that we were to change the value and the sides.
)

00:36:42 Would we have to create a new class? No.
)

00:36:45 So all right. So right now, our class is pretty boring, right?
)

00:36:51 It only creates six sided die with a default value of one.
)

00:36:55 Right? Now what if Ben's like, I want a 20 sided die?
)

00:37:00 OK, ready. Let me run the code. Let me run the code, and the default value is one, and when we roll it, it gets 14.
)

00:37:11 Two, 10, 14, C, so by just changing the template.
)

00:37:19 Let's say we want the default value now to be. 20.
)

00:37:23 Right when you when we manufacture or die and we box them up and we put them all together,
)

00:37:30 the default face that showing is the number 20 right or twenty two.
)

00:37:34 I don't know what the multi-sided dial look like, but now see how the default value of our dye is always 20.
)

00:37:42 And it's randomly generating a number between one and 20 when we roll the dye.
)

00:37:49 OK, Joshua are thinking about like, if we create more dye, well, we're going to get what I want by two.
)

00:37:57 Yeah, we're going to create. We're going to create a bag of dye, right?
)

00:38:02 So not that this has this is not a bag of dye, it's a bag of coins, right?
)

00:38:09 So I know you have like these bags where you put your dye in, right?
)

00:38:13 So how could we like write software that creates this bag of dye and a whole bunch of dye inside of it?
)

00:38:21 Right? And that's what I'm going to show you next. Before we before we carry on.
)

00:38:26 All right. So again, let me just go back to one here.
)

00:38:31 And even if we just make this a one sided dye, you can see here.
)

00:38:37 Let the default value is always one, right? The default value is always one.
)

00:38:44 And then when we roll it, it gets a new value between one and the number of sides that are available to that die.
)

00:38:52 And if I do this just so you can see loss here, I'll say.
)

00:38:58 Original. Value. And then I'll put here.
)

00:39:09 After rolled. Now when I run it.
)

00:39:18 One and then five. One an ABC.
)

00:39:31 OK, now let me just let me there's a couple more things we need to do here.
)

00:39:39 This is great. We've created one die. How boring, right?
)

00:39:43 So the question becomes right, how can we create is anyone?
)

00:39:49 Can gamers who use die? How many does a game typically have one die?
)

00:39:54 Or sometimes you have multiple die? That sometimes has multiple die.
)

00:40:00 All right. So how many die would you have? Well, and one of the games they have, like one of the main guys that we have is like spies.
)

00:40:11 OK, so let's go with say, Lindsay has been hired by a local company to write a pilot program,
)

00:40:19 and she needs to be able to simulate a game that has a bag that contains five dye.
)

00:40:28 And how many sides do those dye have? I'm just curious.
)

00:40:34 Is excited, 20 excited. Well, like for each star, I would be like six to seven on that side.
)

00:40:47 OK, let's just go with this that we need to create five die.
)

00:40:54 And we need to be able to, like, take those die in my hand,
)

00:40:57 shake my hand and then roll the die out on to the table and I can then read all of their their values.
)

00:41:07 Okay, so check this out. Actually, I'm going to go on the Demo three.
)

00:41:11 I'm just going to take all this code and copy it into Demo three, just so I don't mess too much stuff up.
)

00:41:19 Let me go. Demo three here. Demo three Dog Pie.
)

00:41:24 Paste in that code, right? And now I'm going to operate a little bit.
)

00:41:28 Okay. So I'm not I'm just going to cut this out for now, and let's create a variable called bag of.
)

00:41:39 Dice a bag of dice, bag of dice.
)

00:41:44 And if you remember in coding, when we want to put multiple things into a single variable, we create an empty list,
)

00:41:56 an empty list and you saw me do this when we learned about lists, how I could take,
)

00:42:02 you know, a bunch of circles and put the circles into a list and then draw those circles.
)

00:42:08 So here is my my empty bag of dye.
)

00:42:12 There's nothing in here right now. All right. So how can we programmatically in software create a new dye?
)

00:42:21 And add it and place it into our bag of dice.
)

00:42:26 OK, so let's do it. How do we do something five times what the programing concept?
)

00:42:33 You're sick and tired of hearing me say, What do we do when we need to do something five times?
)

00:42:42 Loop it. Yeah, loop it counted loop for Iron Range of five.
)

00:42:47 We want to put five dye into our bag, so what we can now do is we can say, Hey, bag of dice, I want you to append to you.
)

00:43:02 A new die just like that. That's weird. So online, 15, I'm saying, hey, bag of dice,
)

00:43:12 I want you to append because that's how we glue and place new things into our bag of tie into our list and then instead of a string and integer,
)

00:43:23 I'm just saying, Hey, create a new dye just like that. Just die open, close parentheses, just like that.
)

00:43:33 And now, if I print out just at the end here, if I say print out what is the length of our bag of dice,
)

00:43:40 which is going to tell us how many things are in that list, if I run this now, I should have five.
)

00:43:49 Die in that back. Okay, there they are. I can't I'm only pointing out the length right now.
)

00:43:56 I haven't even rolled the dice or done anything yet.
)

00:44:01 But I want to just break this down for you just a little bit easier because I think when we create a new die and we place it into this bad egg,
)

00:44:12 I'm thinking That's. Well, let me let me let me see if I can explain.
)

00:44:18 So what I'm going to do here is it's going to say lowercase dye equals dye just like that.
)

00:44:23 OK. There it is. There it is. I created a variable called dye lowercase.
)

00:44:30 Die, and I said, create a new die and hold on to it as a bat, as a variable called die,
)

00:44:38 and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Hey, die, roll yourself before we stick you in the back, hey, die, roll yourself.
)

00:44:48 And then we're just going to add into the bag. That roll die.
)

00:44:55 OK. So instead of having a bag of dye that just has all the values the same because when I stick a guy in here,
)

00:45:02 it's going to it's going to roll around, right? It's just it's not going to be one.
)

00:45:07 So before we stick that guy into the back, we're going to roll it.
)

00:45:12 We could roll it a thousand times if we wanted to using a loop.
)

00:45:16 But here's what I'm going to create a dye from the dye class.
)

00:45:25 Roll the dye. Append the dye into the list just like that.
)

00:45:35 OK, so here's what I printed out the length print out the number of dye objects in the bag just like that.
)

00:45:47 But now how do I see the value?
)

00:45:54 Of each guy, how do I see the value of each day?
)

00:45:59 This variable contains a list of the five die.
)

00:46:04 So being what we've learned in this class, could I say for every I'll just call it for every.
)

00:46:12 Yeah, we'll call it die in the bag of dice for every.
)

00:46:19 Every guy that's in that bag of dice, could I say print out died dot value?
)

00:46:25 Can I say, Hey, hey, Don, what's your current value? And if I run this right and I'll go back and comment and the second if I run this.
)

00:46:35 You can see here now we have five, five five four one five.
)

00:46:39 If I create another bag of dye. Five, six, three, six, four, five five.
)

00:46:47 We're getting all these different value of as we're manufacturing, you know, bags of dice on our assembly line.
)

00:46:56 They're they're coming out with all these five dye because that's how many Lindsey said we needed in each bag.
)

00:47:03 But if we dumped out the dove from each one?
)

00:47:07 There they are there the the dye coming out differently each time.
)

00:47:14 And if we needed to create a set of dye that has like a bag of dye or a package that contains 100 dyes, we just change our loop to 100.
)

00:47:28 And now we get 100 dye of all different rolled values, a bag of dyes or packaged dyes whenever we want to call it.
)

00:47:37 Just like just like that. So let me let me break this down to iterate.
)

00:47:45 Loop right through each item and list.
)

00:47:52 Print out objects, value property.
)

00:48:00 So here is our completed beginner way to create.
)

00:48:08 A dye that contains six sides by default, the value of that dye is one.
)

00:48:15 We created a list, an empty list. Create empty list.
)

00:48:25 Loop one 100 times. And there you go.
)

00:48:29 We create a new dye. We roll that dye.
)

00:48:34 We then print out the length and then we iterate through the bag of dice one guy at a time and we print out its value.
)

00:48:46 How many different variable names did we create?
)

00:48:51 For the die. None. I mean, one, we only have this bag of dice.
)

00:48:58 So remember that the purpose of the list is to hold multiple things.
)

00:49:03 In this case, the things are not integers, they're not strings, but they're die.
)

00:49:10 And the two things that each guy has is a face value.
)

00:49:15 And a set number of sides. So this is kind of neat until right until.
)

00:49:28 Nathan, our boss says, you know, this is all well and good, we're able to create new dye, but I don't always want six sided die.
)

00:49:38 I may want a 20 sided die or a four sided die or a million sided right.
)

00:49:47 Okay, so we're going to be looking how to handle these types of things, because right now everything is hardcoded right here.
)

00:49:58 It's hard coded. We're saying when you instantiate a new dye, when you create a new dye one, and it's exciting any and all times.
)

00:50:08 Okay? You hear me say this each class, we don't write a lot of code, right?
)

00:50:22 But it's these concepts. And if you're going into web development, when we start talking to databases,
)

00:50:28 you know we're going to use this same type of concept where we connect to a database and then we're going to get a whole bunch of maybe.
)

00:50:38 You know, social media post back and then we're going to, you know, be able to do things with those social media posts, right?
)

00:50:46 Get the count, the count of likes that the number of comments, right?
)

00:50:51 So a post right is an object.
)

00:50:55 Then it contains information about the number of likes, the number of comments, right?
)

00:51:00 Whether it has images and we can it, we can do things with that particular, you know, social media post.
)

00:51:07 But that's what we'll save that for another day. So let's move on now and just step in through here and we're going to copy all this code again.
)

00:51:18 Copy all this code again. But we are now going to create a code.
)

00:51:26 That's going to not have a hard coded.
)

00:51:31 Face value or a hard coded number of sides?
)

00:51:35 Okay, so how do we do this?
)

00:51:39 How do we let me just check the time here? 10:53. How do we how do we how do we do this?
)

00:51:49 So what we do is when we create or instantiate a new dye.
)

00:51:56 We're going to add some parameters after herself, we're going to say, Hey,
)

00:52:00 I want you to have a default value of something and I want you to have a certain number of sides because when we create this new dye,
)

00:52:10 we are going to specify what we want the face value to be and the number of sites.
)

00:52:19 So what we're going to do here now is we're going to change this from a one to that variable that we're passing in called value.
)

00:52:27 And we're going to change this to the number of sides you want me to manufacture or instantiate or create that dye with.
)

00:52:37 So now you see that when we construct a new dye, it's got this self parameter here that always has to be there.
)

00:52:47 We're not going to do anything, but it's just a thing of the language that says this parameter needs to say,
)

00:52:54 Hey, self, look at yourself in the mirror. All right, cool. I know who I am.
)

00:52:58 And then it's going to get a value. And the number of sites?
)

00:53:03 OK. But when we're creating our die right here on Line 15, we now need to say how many what you want,
)

00:53:12 the default value to be and all that make it one here.
)

00:53:17 And how many sides do you want? The die to be will make it 100.
)

00:53:21 OK. So does anyone see the problem?
)

00:53:26 It's not a problem where this when we create this new dye work, we're saying that it requires three things stealth value inside.
)

00:53:37 But you start me. Just add to right here the value and the number of sites.
)

00:53:43 Now I want you to know that this is implied where we don't we don't specify self here on Line 15.
)

00:53:52 You don't do that won't work if it's just a weird thing in the language that's going to screw with your mind.
)

00:54:00 So when I run this now, I'm going to create a dye that's going to have a default value of one and 100 sides.
)

00:54:09 So check this out. Here we go. We actually I want to cut this number down just so you know, from one hundred to five.
)

00:54:19 Let's go back to five. I'm going to create a bag of five dye that are going to be default value of one and have 100 sides.
)

00:54:30 So here I go. There they are five, seventy five, eighty four, eighty two,
)

00:54:37 eight and seventy six and now when when Nathan says no, we need to make a run now of 100000 sided die.
)

00:54:49 Cool. There they are. They are there different die coming out?
)

00:54:56 Why are there six numbers? One is the length that's coming out, right, right here.
)

00:55:04 Oh, OK. Yeah. So let me get rid of that. So you can see.
)

00:55:09 So now I'm creating a bag of five dye that are 100000 sides.
)

00:55:14 And I did not hard code into my into my class anything any hard, hard numbers like one or four or five when I create this dye right here.
)

00:55:32 I'm passing in. The default value I want it to be and the number of sides I want that die to be.
)

00:55:46 OK. We're at the end of the quarter, you have to imagine that the content gets a little bit more tricky, right?
)

00:55:56 And this is, you know, it's not easy stuff to comprehend.
)

00:56:01 So I think we'll do some, some some more examples instead of die.
)

00:56:06 Maybe we'll do stuff with cars or animals or players or just about anything, any physical object that exists we can represent as a class.
)

00:56:19 Okay. Thank.
)

00:56:31 So again. We didn't create separate Barrack that values for the five type of variables for each die.
)

00:56:40 We just had one variable, which happened to be a list and a list can contain multiple things inside,
)

00:56:48 and each one of those things happened to be a dye object.
)

00:56:53 That dye object had a value and it knows how many sides it has, and each dye can do something.
)

00:57:05 By being able to roll itself, by being able to roll it and again when we do the animal classes in a second,
)

00:57:14 you'll start to see this take shape a little bit a little bit more.
)

00:57:19 Okay. When I first learned object oriented programing, which you're learning here it was, it was really hard.
)

00:57:31 It wasn't until I really started teaching it that it started making more sense.
)

00:57:36 Takes a while, takes a lot to wrap your head around. OK, let's do.
)

00:57:40 Let's do some more. Let's start from the very beginning. There we go.
)

00:57:45 Should we do cars or animals? Anybody cars or animals or something else?
)

00:57:52 Anyone have any? What about involves animals?
)

00:57:58 All right. We'll do animals. All right. So what does crate demo Dash five Pi?
)

00:58:05 Animals. OK, here we go. Just like animals, we sing that song.
)

00:58:11 I don't know. Just another five. Yeah, Maroon five.
)

00:58:17 Thank you, Colin. All right. So let's create. Let's do dogs.
)

00:58:23 Let's do dogs. Let's create a dog class. We're going to manufacture.
)

00:58:29 Digital dogs, digital dogs.
)

00:58:32 OK, so there is a good name for our class, remember that the first letter of our class name gets capitalized circle rectangle, polygon, right?
)

00:58:42 All graph, win all capital. Those are classes. And now let's create our constructor function when we create a new dog.
)

00:58:54 Right? Define Dunder init. Dunder.
)

00:59:00 Self. Okay, so by default, when we construct a new dog, we're just going to do that, but.
)

00:59:09 What are some properties that we should have for our dogs?
)

00:59:16 I hear list of actually not all software list, but.
)

00:59:22 Property properties, list of properties of dogs.
)

00:59:27 So tell me what are some things? If we're like manufacturing dogs, right?
)

00:59:35 What are some things, what are some properties dogs have? What are some properties?
)

00:59:40 Dogs have somebody. OK, breed, keep going.
)

00:59:50 Gender. Gender and what else keep going.
)

00:59:54 Color, color, size. OK, good, small, medium, large, yeah.
)

01:00:02 Keep going. What else?
)

01:00:11 It's not a trick question, just saying go look name.
)

01:00:15 All right, cool. What about wait, wait.
)

01:00:23 How about legs? Kyle.
)

01:00:28 What else? Watch your ears.
)

01:00:37 Yeah, they all have different irritants, but let's let's just for now focus on breed, gender, color, size, name.
)

01:00:47 We'll get rid of all this stuff. We'll just focus on these five properties from now.
)

01:00:52 All right. List. Of methods.
)

01:01:01 That dogs can do so. Tell me some things dogs can do.
)

01:01:05 What are some things? That dogs can do. They can bark, they can bark.
)

01:01:15 They can run, they can run, they can jump, they can eat, they can jump.
)

01:01:26 Then they can go potty right there. Fair list of things that our dogs and our.
)

01:01:36 Code that we're going to right here can do. Yeah.
)

01:01:42 Yes, Chris. All right. So what we want to do now is we want to when we construct a new dog, right?
)

01:01:49 We want to be able to give it a breed. A gender.
)

01:01:57 A color a size. Name.
)

01:02:01 OK. So when we create a new dog in our software code.
)

01:02:07 We're going to want to give it a brief gender, color, size and a name.
)

01:02:13 Can you? Makes sense so far when we create a new doc, so self.
)

01:02:22 Hey, dog, I want your breed to be whatever value we gave you to construct yourself.
)

01:02:31 Hey, well, hey, I want your color to be whatever color we told you to be.
)

01:02:38 And then I moved the Zoom window here. I want your.
)

01:02:46 Sized to be whatever size I told you to be. And I want your name to be whatever name I told you to be.
)

01:02:54 OK, so let's cut it off first dog, OK?
)

01:02:59 I think his name a reserved word in Python. Maybe so give me.
)

01:03:03 Let me credit me in here. Ben to mean.
)

01:03:10 Does anyone have a dog that anyone have a dog?
)

01:03:15 I have a dog. His name is lucky and he's kind of our team right now.
)

01:03:19 All right. So I created a book called Lucky. There it is.
)

01:03:23 Lucky the dog and we're going to make lucky a dog.
)

01:03:27 And now we need to give our software the breed.
)

01:03:33 So the breed is going to be a string, right? The breed is going to be a string.
)

01:03:37 So. Lindsay, what kind of dog is lucky?
)

01:03:43 Lucky is a black lab slash border collie, black lab slash border.
)

01:03:53 Colony. OK, now the next thing is gender.
)

01:03:56 What's the gender of the dog, male male and what is the color of your dog lacked?
)

01:04:06 OK. What is the size? Is it a large dog? It's a medium.
)

01:04:11 All right. Medium. And what is? Oh, it's lucky.
)

01:04:15 There it is. Right? All right. So now just by doing this code right here, I've created Lindsay's dog in software, right?
)

01:04:27 There it is. I have created Lindsay's dog in software.
)

01:04:32 In fact, if I say print out what kind of dog is lucky, I'll say breed just like that, it's going to come back and tell me that Lindsay's dog.
)

01:04:45 Is an error, OK, has no attribute name. I knew a new name was going to give me an issue.
)

01:04:52 Hold on one second. Lucky dot, lucky dot name.
)

01:04:59 OK, hold on. You're Reid. Gender, yes, thank you.
)

01:05:08 So that gender. And let's see if that fixes it, Robert.
)

01:05:19 Name name has given me. So let me just go right here.
)

01:05:26 So don't name names, I think name may be a reserved word.
)

01:05:33 Let's just call it. What's another word for name?
)

01:05:39 What's another variable for name that I could use, I don't. OK, very formal now.
)

01:05:46 OK, so I'm just going to change name to title. Let's see if it works now.
)

01:05:52 Go. Sized up, my fault means you didn't switch the name or the title.
)

01:06:15 One with code, let's just check my code self read.
)

01:06:21 So I have one two three four five one two three four five.
)

01:06:29 Right there there's that one two three four five.
)

01:06:37 Lucky that breed. It should be working, it's working on mine.
)

01:06:44 Yeah. Hold on a second. Let me just run this again.
)

01:06:53 Yeah, hold on. What love to see what's going on here?
)

01:07:09 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Signs that oh, look, look, look, see.
)

01:07:16 Self thought title self, that title name probably wouldn't work.
)

01:07:21 That was my goof ready. So there it is. There is Lindsay's dog and there is it's breed, right?
)

01:07:27 So in software, we have a variable called Lucki.
)

01:07:32 That's an object. And that object knows a whole bunch of things about itself.
)

01:07:38 It knows its breed, its gender, its color, its size and its title.
)

01:07:43 Right. Just like that. And if I create, I'll create my dog.
)

01:07:49 Dr. If a dog is a he's black and white model, actually, he is a English springer spaniel who is barking in the hallway right now.
)

01:08:05 English Springer Spaniel. And then he is a male dog.
)

01:08:15 He is color, he's black and white and he is thighs medium.
)

01:08:26 And his name is Tucker.
)

01:08:29 Okay, so I created right from this bunch of code here to objects that happen to be dogs that have one, two, three, four or five properties.
)

01:08:43 We have no methods. These dogs can't do anything right now.
)

01:08:46 And by the way, if I print out Tucker as they breed right, I can then see that Tucker is an English springer spaniel.
)

01:08:59 So I don't know about you, but everything, you know, kind of what we've learned in this class, right,
)

01:09:06 this this like totally changes the game because unlike anything else, we are creating a template.
)

01:09:16 Kind of like the graphics library, where we're able to define an object, right, which has.
)

01:09:26 Instance variables. These are instance variables, by the way, let me just put this here.
)

01:09:32 Instance, variables, that means for this instance of lucky and or Tucker, here are these values and each one is different.
)

01:09:42 But we made Lindsey's dog and my dog right in the software through this same template.
)

01:09:49 Okay. Should we take a break, by the way?
)

01:09:54 Should we take a break? 11 plus 11 plus 12 plus 10 is 22, so I'll stop the recorder.
)

01:10:06 What's? I'll stop the recorder I wanted to do right.
)

01:10:12 So, OK, so data, it's totally a natural thing to find coding difficult.
)

01:10:20 OK. That's good to know, because some people will make it look like it's easy.
)

01:10:28 And I probably taught maybe two thousand students over nine years, maybe not,
)

01:10:33 I don't one hundred and four, ninety five percent of those students, this stuff is very difficult.
)

01:10:40 But Joshua just know that a lot of the students that I do keep in touch with.
)

01:10:47 I have done really well, and they had this is their first programing course, so it takes time.
)

01:10:56 Right? Think about just think about high school, right?
)

01:11:00 And how many years we're taught like English, write English as a language, right?
)

01:11:05 It has syntax. It has semantics, just like all this stuff.
)

01:11:09 Right. And here we are nine weeks later with a new language.
)

01:11:13 And, you know, give yourself some credit for what you know already.
)

01:11:18 You may still not be as good as you.
)

01:11:21 One day will be at it, but I was I was that same person as Joshua, so and I still have a ton to learn.
)

01:11:30 So here we go. So there are two dogs and it says recording yes.
)

01:11:36 Does it say recording somewhere? Yup. All right.
)

01:11:40 I need to take my glasses off because my eyes lately are just I don't.
)

01:11:44 I don't. It's new glasses. I don't know if it's out or I don't know.
)

01:11:48 So here we go. We got two dogs. Yay.
)

01:11:53 Yay, we got two dogs. And right now, our dogs are kind of boring, right?
)

01:11:58 All right. One more dog. Let me create one more dog. I'll create Bella.
)

01:12:05 She was a dog of ours. She's no longer here. She was an English springer spaniel.
)

01:12:12 She was female. Notice how the type.
)

01:12:17 You notice how this is changing. See this right here. How it's highlighting what I need to do next.
)

01:12:23 She was tricolor. I'll just leave that to three colors.
)

01:12:29 She was a medium dog and her name was Bella.
)

01:12:34 Bella Luna, beautiful moment. And if I print out, like, print out Bella's value of, I don't know, gender, it's going to print out female, right?
)

01:12:48 So if I run this code, we got Lindsay's dog, our dog, and we have Bella, who is a female.
)

01:12:55 Right? So I have these three objects in my code that have these five properties, but they can't do anything right now.
)

01:13:05 Our dogs are unable to do anything. OK.
)

01:13:09 And also what I'm going to teach you is that you see how I'm accessing these property names like this breed, breed, gender.
)

01:13:19 I'm going to show you a better way to do this because this is but there's just always a better, more professional way to do things.
)

01:13:29 But again, think about this.
)

01:13:32 This is the first time in this class where we've created a template and we've made stuff just like from the graphics library.
)

01:13:41 We've we've we've used that template to craft to create Locky, Tucker and Bella in software.
)

01:13:50 OK, so let's go back. We need our dogs to be able to bark, right?
)

01:13:55 So what we need to do is define, define a new method.
)

01:14:01 Right in our class that all dogs can do our template,
)

01:14:06 that when we make all dogs and we're going to define a new method, lowercase bark just like that.
)

01:14:13 And we need to tell that particular dog itself to bark.
)

01:14:19 That's why I put self in there. And then I'm going to say print.
)

01:14:24 Woof, woof. Just like that, because that's how it Dogwood border, right?
)

01:14:31 We print out the words. Woof, woof. Right. So I could tell any of my dogs now.
)

01:14:38 To Bach. So let's take lucky and say, hey, lucky.
)

01:14:43 Bach, just like that. It's a method. We do the parentheses.
)

01:14:47 We don't give it. The self here just needs to be here, but we don't put it here.
)

01:14:53 And now when I run this. We've seen the same information and then we see Lindsay's dog walking.
)

01:15:03 And we could do the same for Tucker. And we could do the same for Bella.
)

01:15:13 Right, all these dogs are made from the same template, they can all do the same thing.
)

01:15:19 Now wouldn't it be nice? Instead of just Wolf Wolf, we knew which dog was barking, right?
)

01:15:25 So could I just say, could I just do this? Could I say, I'm going to use that string here because I'm being lazy?
)

01:15:33 And could I say, Hey, self, what's your title? Is your name?
)

01:15:42 Just like that. And now when I run it, it says Lucky Wolf.
)

01:15:46 Wolf Tucker. Wolf Wolf. Bella Luna Wolf with.
)

01:15:51 So I'm telling each one of those objects, what's your name?
)

01:15:55 What's your title? And then I'm putting out the words with. Or I could just do this.
)

01:16:02 Right, Bella Part Tucker barked, Lucky [INAUDIBLE].
)

01:16:08 So watch us. Lucky Tucker Park, Bella Luna Park, OK, I guess I was getting ahead of myself, I use the quotation marks.
)

01:16:21 What do you mean, Joshua? Like I try to like in the parentheses versus lucky breed?
)

01:16:31 I actually got lucky title collar quotation is a comma and then another quotation that says lucky breeds,
)

01:16:41 so they print out like lucky is the Black Lab colleague or.
)

01:16:46 Well, let's talk about that, right? So here we created our our three dogs.
)

01:16:52 We gave them a breed, gender, color, size and title.
)

01:16:57 Right. And there they are.
)

01:17:02 They all have this. Those five properties and all of them can bark, right?
)

01:17:08 All of them can bark, right? So let's do this again now and let's create.
)

01:17:14 We did bark. Let's do run. Let's create another method. Called Run, and we're going to tell you the dog, too.
)

01:17:24 And I'm just going to this copy this. What's?
)

01:17:45 So I'm just adding additional methods for each of those objects.
)

01:17:50 And now I can instead of Barak, I can say, Hey, hey, Tucker.
)

01:17:56 Park. Just like that. I meant run.
)

01:18:06 Sorry. Hey, Tucker. Run. Just like that again, these are all method bark run.
)

01:18:15 They're different things, and you can see here we're getting Tucker to run.
)

01:18:20 We're getting Tucker to run if I want to get if I want to get lucky to run her lucky run.
)

01:18:36 All three dogs made from the same template, the same class, all have five instance variables, five properties.
)

01:18:48 Right now they have two methods. They can bark and they can run and we can do the same thing with each jump and potty.
)

01:18:59 So if I say if I create a new method called potty. Kind of put that self in there, and I put in that.
)

01:19:09 Is going to stay. Just like that now when I want a particular dog to go potty, I'll say, Hey, Bella, go potty.
)

01:19:25 Now. Gerri, what do you think of this stuff?
)

01:19:35 It's pretty cool. It's a lot.
)

01:19:40 It is a lot, and it's it's the sheer fact that again, we're not creating function functions like do a bunch of code and then they're done.
)

01:19:51 Maybe they print something out. Maybe they send something back, but they forget everything they know.
)

01:19:57 And when we create objects, these objects live on right from this stuff that we created them with.
)

01:20:08 Right? They know their breed. They know all these properties.
)

01:20:12 They know they can bark, they know they can run, they know they can go potty.
)

01:20:18 And just like we did with the dye, let's say I want to create a pack of dogs, right?
)

01:20:27 I no longer want to create variables for each of my dogs because that's kind of not a we wouldn't do
)

01:20:38 that in in a professional environment because we would have to create variables for each of the dogs.
)

01:20:46 But what if we want to model what we did with the bag of dice, right?
)

01:20:51 The bag of dice and create a pack of dogs? Right. So I'm going to copy all this code and not mess this up.
)

01:20:59 Copy all that code. Go in, create a new program and paste it in.
)

01:21:04 Save it. I'm going to call this demo Dash six that way.
)

01:21:10 And instead of creating right, I'm just going to clean all this up instead of creating these variables here.
)

01:21:17 Right? What I'm going to do right is I am going to not just do this, I'm going to get rid of it all.
)

01:21:27 I'm going to create a list pack of dogs. There they are.
)

01:21:32 Pack of dogs. It's an empty list. But my job now is to be able to create like 100.
)

01:21:41 Dogs, right? I'm going to make the same dog for now, just for my example.
)

01:21:46 And then we're going to have them all go potty at the same time. OK, so how do I do that right?
)

01:21:52 For I in range of 100 creating a pack, 100 dogs.
)

01:21:59 Saying, Hey, pack of dogs, a pen to yourself, a new dog, and the dog is going to be a.
)

01:22:10 We're going to do poodles, OK? A poodle. The gender is going to be will make them all male.
)

01:22:18 We'll make the color, they're all white.
)

01:22:21 Will make the size all small, and we'll just call them instead of a name, we'll just call them a poodle just for now.
)

01:22:30 OK, so there is my pack of dogs. I just created.
)

01:22:35 Let me run it just to make sure it doesn't throw up. All right, good.
)

01:22:38 So in software, I've created a bunch of 100 dogs.
)

01:22:43 They're living in this pack of dogs. They're all in there. So how do I get them all to go potty, right?
)

01:22:50 I don't get them all to go potty. Well, I can say for every lowercase dog or four, I doesn't matter.
)

01:22:57 For dog in pack of dogs, for every pack of dogs is a list we can iterate through lists.
)

01:23:06 One list element at a time, Jerry. And then we can say, Hey dog, go potty.
)

01:23:13 Just like that. So I'm going back, I created 100 dogs.
)

01:23:22 And now I'm telling all those dogs to go potty. So let's do it.
)

01:23:30 Now they are they're all going potty at the same time.
)

01:23:34 Just by right, rating 100 of them and sticking each dog in a list and you know what a better name instead of a poodle.
)

01:23:45 Let's just call the name of the dog a number.
)

01:23:49 So I'm going to take I, which is the iterator zero, one, two, three or four.
)

01:23:55 And I'm going to make it into a string and we're going to call our dog a number.
)

01:24:00 Your dog zero, your dog one. That's that's your title.
)

01:24:04 And now. Please hold a.
)

01:24:13 So now you can see each of the dogs, dogs zero is going potty, one five all the way up through.
)

01:24:23 Don, ninety nine zero to ninety nine is 100, so now I have a pack of dogs made in software.
)

01:24:30 They're all the same, right? We're just being generic now.
)

01:24:36 But how about them apples? How about them apples?
)

01:24:39 Then think about games. Think about games and how we may create a player class.
)

01:24:46 And some of you saw the video that I shared with you all about what we're going to do on Wednesday is create a player class to.
)

01:24:56 To to do what kind of work we're doing here, but with gameplay.
)

01:25:02 Right. All your games have when you like. I didn't know nothing about games, right?
)

01:25:08 But you know you, you have maybe a name, you have armor, you have weapons, you have,
)

01:25:16 you know how you have all these different things and that's what kind of what we're doing here.
)

01:25:21 We're creating the template, the class for each doc or for each player or for each dot.
)

01:25:29 Yeah, it lends that question.
)

01:25:32 So lately I've been playing in like Sonic Forces, like on my computer, and I just realized something then this like code like,
)

01:25:43 how do you think they make different classes for each character's skills?
)

01:25:48 Like, how do they do that? So we're going to be doing that on Wednesday.
)

01:25:54 So just like because like a Ali, sorry, Ali.
)

01:25:59 No, no, no, no. You're cool. My eyes were just bugging me when we think about a list, right?
)

01:26:06 Your player has a list of skills or a list of weapons or a list of things that it can do.
)

01:26:13 And when we when we talk on Wednesday and when we develop a game,
)

01:26:21 one of the things that a player is going to have is a list of weapons, a list of skills and things like that.
)

01:26:31 All right, so. OK. Yeah. Yeah, good question.
)

01:26:36 Thanks. Let's do it just right. The out of this like on this play, this kind of looks like a game mechanic from a game I've been playing recently.
)

01:26:46 Yeah. Well, the whole point of this is this to show you just that.
)

01:26:51 If you can only write simple code like we've written all quarter long before,
)

01:26:57 you're going to have the need to do stuff like this, I didn't create variables for each dog.
)

01:27:04 They're not there. They are an element in a list or a pack of dogs, and they're all sitting in this list, all next to each other.
)

01:27:13 They don't fight, but there they are there.
)

01:27:17 If I change this to, you know. 100000 dogs.
)

01:27:23 Not that I want to have 100000 dogs go potty and print that out all at one time, right?
)

01:27:30 But there I go. I commit 100000 dogs or if I want like 10 dogs, there they go.
)

01:27:37 Right, there they go. Right? There they go, there are the 10 dogs 039 all going potty now.
)

01:27:47 The one thing I wanted to tell you kind of going back to what we had before and then we'll probably cut cut this on.
)

01:27:55 For today, because this is complex stuff, is I told you that it's not cool to say like dog got gender right or dog scholar.
)

01:28:09 It's better to create methods and this is on a quiz.
)

01:28:15 These are called getters and setters, accessories and beauty towards right getters and setters, not dogs, not Irish setters.
)

01:28:27 But here, let me take this out, getters. Sweaters or accessories mutate towards that's that the computer science name,
)

01:28:40 where these getters and setters are going to be a way for us to get the dog's breed.
)

01:28:51 But right now, we don't have a really good way of doing that or changing the dog's name, right?
)

01:29:00 Or something about that dog. We could say Dog, don't breed and change the dog's breed.
)

01:29:09 But you don't ever really want to do that. What you want to do is create waves in your code, in your class to gracefully change things.
)

01:29:22 You don't want to access these property names directly. It's a really bad habit.
)

01:29:27 So let's go in here and say define a new getter called get on the score breed self.
)

01:29:39 Return self-taught breed. Now that's kind of weird, right?
)

01:29:45 We're saying we created a method called Get Breed that we can call and we're saying, Hey, dog, look at yourself.
)

01:29:53 What kind of dog are you? And then it's going to say it's going to send back.
)

01:29:59 To me, the brief, this is the way that you should get information about your objects.
)

01:30:10 So now I can say right, instead of going potty, I can say dog dot.
)

01:30:17 Get on the score, breathe just like that.
)

01:30:22 Not not this, not dog, don't.
)

01:30:27 Dogs don't do that, don't do that bad. But look at I created a nice, elegant, programmatic way to get me the breed of a dog.
)

01:30:39 And now when I run this code? I get an error, right?
)

01:30:44 So what a team here, it's saying, oh, so it gave me that dog breed, but I didn't do anything with it.
)

01:30:54 Could I could I do this? Could I say print out?
)

01:30:59 Whatever got returned to me, that was my fault before, could I print it out and could I say, Yeah, they're all tools?
)

01:31:08 That's the way that you would do things. And I could do the same thing, create another.
)

01:31:15 Get her, get her, get the color.
)

01:31:20 Hey, dog, look at yourself. Return to whoever asked you what color you are.
)

01:31:30 And. Print out, Hey, dog, get your color.
)

01:31:36 Get your. Color just like that.
)

01:31:40 Getters and setters, these are accessories, accessories, we're accessing information,
)

01:31:48 we're accessing information about an object, about a dog, and we're saying, Hey dog, which a breed?
)

01:31:55 Look at yourself. Send back to me what you are and when I run it.
)

01:32:01 You can see here. Right, poodle, white, this is the color, and this is the professional way of returning information.
)

01:32:10 We never want to do this. That's bad. OK, that's bad.
)

01:32:15 That's a bad thing to do. And you saw me do it probably in some of the videos about the dye or the player class or something,
)

01:32:22 because I've learned so I've learned since I've made that video that it's better to do things and more pro right?
)

01:32:30 Best practice to do things like I'm doing here now. These are all good.
)

01:32:35 These are getters. This gets me information about a dog.
)

01:32:39 But what if I want to change the dog's name? Let's say we adopt the dog and the dog.
)

01:32:47 His name changes. So we need a way to mutate, to change, right?
)

01:32:54 To set the dog's name. And again.
)

01:32:59 This is the way to do it. We define a new method and we call it set getters and setters get ers and setters, not dogs, that will call it title.
)

01:33:10 We'll say, hey, self, it's time that you change your name.
)

01:33:15 Whatever new name I gave you. But when I changed the dog's name, I need to give it the the new title I need to like say, Hey, your new title is this?
)

01:33:28 And then you need to set yourself to it. So let's take.
)

01:33:33 Let's take all of the dogs and change their titles and their titles to begin with where the number zero three ninety nine?
)

01:33:45 Right? So how can I now go in?
)

01:33:49 I'm just going to come of these out for now. How could I go in and say, Hey, dog, hey, hey dog, set your title right?
)

01:34:00 There it is. Set. Title. But I need to give you a new right, a new number because we adopted or we adopted, you know, a hundred dogs.
)

01:34:11 So I'm going to say, Hey dog, take your, Oh, this is interesting.
)

01:34:16 How do I get the dogs? How do I get the dog's current title right now?
)

01:34:23 How do I get? Do I have a method where I can get their title?
)

01:34:27 Or do I need to create one to get their title? I need to create another method get the title of the dog.
)

01:34:39 That's the name and send it back. There we go.
)

01:34:43 These are this is the proper way to do things. So I have one dog.
)

01:34:49 Class. I construct the dog. I can tell the dog to park.
)

01:34:55 I can tell the dog to run. I could tell the dog to go potty if I need to get the dog breed.
)

01:35:02 I have a getter or a word access or method to do that.
)

01:35:09 I have a way to get the dog's color away, to get the dog's title and a way to set the dog's title.
)

01:35:16 And now down here we're saying, Hey, take your current title, your name.
)

01:35:23 Let's just do this. So I need to say, Hey, dog, what's your current title?
)

01:35:30 And I'm just going to add to that the string.
)

01:35:36 Just just give me a second here. Adopted. Just that.
)

01:35:41 Just that right there, I'm going to say, Hey, dog,
)

01:35:45 set your title to get your current title and add to yourself the word adopted and then go to yourself and that's your new name.
)

01:35:56 And then right after I do that, I can say, Hey, dog. Get your title.
)

01:36:04 We have a method to get a dog's title. We do right here and I'm going to print it out.
)

01:36:10 And now we can see all of our dogs adopted. Hopefully.
)

01:36:19 Yeah. All right. See that. Get title not defined.
)

01:36:23 See, I make errors. So what I need to do here is say, Hey dog, get your title.
)

01:36:30 Hey, don't get your title. And now when I run this, they're all going to be adopted.
)

01:36:36 See that all 10 dogs got named, renamed from zero one two three four five.
)

01:36:42 They've all been had their names change to their old name zero plus the word adopted.
)

01:36:54 Now, I don't know about you, this is some hairy stuff.
)

01:36:58 This is, you know, we went from writing simple programs to creating object oriented code, and I'm just trying to leave it all there.
)

01:37:07 And don't worry, I'll give you all the code. And it's a little mind boggling and it's a little overwhelming.
)

01:37:14 And I'm not going to overwhelm you with another half hour of what we've done today.
)

01:37:20 We'll do more of it on Wednesday. So thoughts on classes, I need some feedback.
)

01:37:26 I mean, I would appreciate some feedback. I think this is very interesting.
)

01:37:35 OK. It is somebody else. Could I do?
)

01:37:45 Can I do one more 10 minute example on the cars for today?
)

01:37:49 Is that is that OK? Just to help you out a little bit more? That's fine with me.
)

01:37:54 I'm good with that. All right. Let's just do that. All right. Sorry for that.
)

01:37:58 I have to go get my flu shot. All right, here we go.
)

01:38:04 To demo is this Demo six picked up on a demo.
)

01:38:12 Seven that fine. All right. All right, here we go.
)

01:38:17 Ready. Here we go. We're going to create a class to represent cars and cars ready so class.
)

01:38:25 Car, there it is, class car, no parentheses. Now we need to create our constructor.
)

01:38:33 Dunder Anek Dunder Self will fill in the rest in a minute.
)

01:38:40 We define our main. And now let's get going.
)

01:38:46 So when we construct the car, what are some of the things that the properties that cars have?
)

01:38:54 Make. Model.
)

01:39:00 What else, what? What else other color you're?
)

01:39:12 Let's go with that. Just for now. There we go.
)

01:39:17 So now we need to take these parameters right, these properties and put them up here.
)

01:39:24 Make. Model. Color. Yeah.
)

01:39:29 So when we construct the new car, there we go. OK, so let's create a new car.
)

01:39:34 Let's just go back to the way we've been doing it. Here we go. Let's create and we have a car.
)

01:39:41 Give me a car. Just belt one out. What about us over 2010, can we?
)

01:39:50 All right. So let's Korea, is that your car? All right.
)

01:39:55 So let's create. Lynn Lindsay's car variable, there it is, Lindsay's car, and we're going to create a new car and we're going to say hi to.
)

01:40:10 Camry. What color is it, Lindsey Silver, Silver and what year 2010, right?
)

01:40:19 Yeah. All right. So I could create the year as a number right, just like that doesn't have to be a strength, right?
)

01:40:28 And. There's Lindsay's car, there's Lindsay's car, right?
)

01:40:35 So there it is, right? But I taught you in the last lesson that I need to create some accessories for getters to be able to properly,
)

01:40:47 professionally get info about each and every car that we create.
)

01:40:53 So could I define a new method, a new accessory or a new getter that says get?
)

01:40:59 Underscore make. And I'll say, hey.
)

01:41:05 Send back whatever your make is, and could I do the same for model color in the air?
)

01:41:13 Let me do this, by the way. This is just like one of the programing assignment problems.
)

01:41:21 Although. One more and I'll fix everything.
)

01:41:30 So we got we got we got make. We got model and model.
)

01:41:39 They turn the model. Give me back the model.
)

01:41:44 We got the color. We got the color.
)

01:41:50 We got the color, and then we got the year, we got the year.
)

01:41:55 So this is cool because now we have things built into our code that can look at any car we present itself and say, Hey, what's your model?
)

01:42:05 What's your color? What's your year? And we're not. We're not doing what I showed you earlier.
)

01:42:11 We're not doing this. We're not saying, Hey, Lindsay's car. Hey, Lindsay's car in the car?
)

01:42:19 We're not saying that anymore. OK, that's that's bad because we want.
)

01:42:27 We want to be able to not just say, hey, what property, what, what color are you?
)

01:42:32 We want programmatic ways to be told what the color is.
)

01:42:38 OK? Just it's it's a little bit more than I want to share with you.
)

01:42:43 But this this this works well. It can be really dangerous.
)

01:42:49 So what I do now, as I say, Hey, Lindsay's car get.
)

01:42:55 Was it color? Is that the one, the color? What did they have before I had color?
)

01:42:59 Yeah. So I said, call the method, get color and tell me what color Lindsay's car is.
)

01:43:05 And it's silver. Right? And now I can say, print out, Hey, Lindsay's car, get your year.
)

01:43:15 What year are you? Get year? And it should say.
)

01:43:20 2010. There it is. And now when I create another object, I'll just do another one.
)

01:43:29 OK. Gales are.
)

01:43:35 Car. Alexis, what is it?
)

01:43:40 Model three left the color black, yeah.
)

01:43:48 Twenty sixteen. Right. And now I could do the same thing.
)

01:43:52 Ford girls car, which is just another object, and I'll do it right here.
)

01:43:57 I'll say, hey, what is Gail's? Car color and what is.
)

01:44:09 Gail. Car year and.
)

01:44:17 Black 2016. So to wrap it up, we create a model, not not car model, but a way in software template.
)

01:44:29 Right. A class that describes when we create a new car, what properties it should have.
)

01:44:36 And then we create a list of methods right for that particular object car class.
)

01:44:45 That can like do things get the model, get the get the mate, get the model, get the color, get the year.
)

01:44:53 In fact, we can add a new one that says maybe got a paint job, maybe the car got painted that color.
)

01:45:05 Upset caller, this last thing, by the way, and then we'll say, hey, hey, self, say your color to that new color that we're going to tell you to.
)

01:45:14 So I need to go here now and say, Hey. That's a new color.
)

01:45:19 And now I'm going to change Gail color of her car right after here, I'm going to say, check this out.
)

01:45:27 I'm going to say Gail's car. That sent color.
)

01:45:32 And we're going to make it purple. All right.
)

01:45:36 And then we're going to print out Gail's car color after we change it, we'll just do it down here and you'll see that.
)

01:45:47 We're going to be changing our color. It was black, and now it's purple.
)

01:45:59 I see all the smoke coming from all over your heads right now because this stuff is.
)

01:46:05 But then this is like if you're taking JavaScript, if you're taking HP, we're going to be using this concept over and over and over again.
)

01:46:15 A web page is actually an object. If you think about it.
)

01:46:21 It's this collection of HTML elements.
)

01:46:25 Some of them will have classes. I ds will have content between tags and everything in JavaScript isn't object in on the web page,
)

01:46:41 and we'll be using stuff like this to go get information about a paragraph.
)

01:46:46 Text about an image, so bear some context for you all the time at the tone is eleven, fifty nine and 17 seconds to.
)

01:47:01 Parting thoughts, questions, concerns. And look, and looking at you all.
)

01:47:18 That was not a single question in chat today. That does means everybody is toast.
)

01:47:25 So I know I know for a fact that kids watch our show.
)

01:47:29 I think I'm the only one to ask the question today.
)

01:47:34 There's something now, Jack Jerry says crickets.
)

01:47:38 Yeah, you know, remote zone. Tough stuff, man. Totally different in a physical classroom, right?
)

01:47:44 We'd be eating pizza right now. So tough concept.
)

01:47:49 It took me a long time to understand getting back to what Joshua mentioned before,
)

01:47:56 and it's very normal for new programmers like yourselves right to do things the way we used to do.
)

01:48:03 But once you understand how to represent. Something with.
)

01:48:11 Instance variables. With methods, right, getters and setters accesses accessories and mutates.
)

01:48:21 It your life as a software person can become you can step up your game a lot.
)

01:48:27 So one more thing in the chat, Lindsey gives a smile. OK.
)

01:48:33 So on Wednesday, we'll do a little bit more and then we'll I've created a game, a simple game using players that have different weapons,
)

01:48:45 and those weapons have different weights like a sword versus a bow versus a hammer.
)

01:48:52 They have all different weights.
)

01:48:54 So how can we write a game with, I don't know, a thousand players randomly battling one another, pulling out their weapons, having a battle.
)

01:49:08 One of them was going to die, and then how do we eventually get down to one player left?
)

01:49:14 Sounds like a big while, Luke, to me, sounds like a list of player objects and sounds like some decision logic.
)

01:49:23 And it sounds like some fun. So. I'm going to turn off the recorder.
)

01:49:29 Oh, by the way, there is a you should see in canvas now and something in Module nine to be able to leave feedback for for me in this course.
)

01:49:41 It's something that they do to me every quarter and I must say do to me, but I'm on this.
)

01:49:48 I'm on this practice. This thing at school where it's called tenure track, where they teach you how to teach right.
)

01:49:56 And that feedback gets seen by it gets seen by me like way after the course is over,
)

01:50:04 just so you know, it'll have no reflection on your grade will be, Oh Jerry, give me bad feedback.
)

01:50:09 But it's a way to to give the college information about me. The course the good, bad and ugly.
)

01:50:15 And a lot of you have done this before and you've done it for other instructors.
)

01:50:18 So it's not it's not required, but I highly encourage you to do it so.
)

01:50:29 When I loaded into Kansas today. Well, this might be odd, but it said I had a we acquired a weevil here,
)

01:50:40 weevil to do on you and then my English teacher, it was required and then I couldn't get out of it.
)

01:50:48 Oh, really? Oh, God, my belly button that said do later.
)

01:50:54 It did give me that button like so quickly before class with me almost late.
)

01:51:02 Oh all right. Well, I'll let. I'll let the people that handle that, I'll let them know.
)

01:51:09 But again, it's not required, but it's very, very helpful and I get to go over them.
)

01:51:16 They're all anonymous, and I'm really thankful for any type of feedback which you already know.
)

01:51:22 So with that, I'm not going to give me any more. I'm going to shut up and have a good day and I'll see on Wednesday.
)

01:51:29 You'll also have a good day to you and.
)
