# Clickable Recording Transcript

00:00:00 [Now that Gerry is here telling us on Jerry Jones, we hit the record button.
](http://youtube.com&t=0)

00:00:05 [So I wanted to do. Yeah, I just wanted to share something totally unrelated to code, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5)

00:00:10 [But you know, you're all sitting on on on Zoom, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=10)

00:00:13 [And I'm sitting here and you see, you know, me coding, talking, whatever it may be, but I wanted to share with you how blown up my screen is.
](http://youtube.com&t=13)

00:00:25 [Can you see that? Yeah, so that's that's me teaching to you.
](http://youtube.com&t=25)

00:00:32 [But right when you when you see it from your end, kind of here, let's get rid of it.
](http://youtube.com&t=32)

00:00:38 [Come on this. That's what you see. All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=38)

00:00:43 [So I just thought I'd share that because Zoom, right, does a really good job of allowing me to zoom in my screen, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=43)

00:00:52 [And allow you to see, like I said, just the normal view.
](http://youtube.com&t=52)

00:00:57 [So, yeah, and that's that's why you never want to allow me to drive a car, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=57)

00:01:04 [Because I I'm like, I don't know. There used to be a kids cartoon called Mister Mr Magoo.
](http://youtube.com&t=64)

00:01:12 [I don't know that it remembers that, but he he was a character that drove around and he couldn't see.
](http://youtube.com&t=72)

00:01:19 [So thankfully, my wife read it. Yeah, I remember this and go, Yeah.
](http://youtube.com&t=79)

00:01:25 [So yeah, thankfully, my wife and, you know, friends, you know, drive, drive me around.
](http://youtube.com&t=85)

00:01:32 [All right. So let's get started. Let's get started. We're in.
](http://youtube.com&t=92)

00:01:36 [We're nearing the end. This is the last module. This is like the last like full module on on something called classes, the finding classes,
](http://youtube.com&t=96)

00:01:47 [which you've already done using the graphics library, but you didn't know much about it other than, Hey, here's I want to.
](http://youtube.com&t=107)

00:01:54 [I want a graphics window. I want to circle. I want all all these things.
](http://youtube.com&t=114)

00:01:59 [But how can we like develop those types of things on our on our own right?
](http://youtube.com&t=119)

00:02:05 [So that's what this module is all about. This is the last problem set.
](http://youtube.com&t=125)

00:02:09 [This is the last learning guide. Clear. This is the last written quiz.
](http://youtube.com&t=129)

00:02:14 [And next Monday. I don't think we'll have class because it's Thanksgiving week.
](http://youtube.com&t=134)

00:02:20 [There won't be any need on. Some of you wanted to take the Microsoft Python certification.
](http://youtube.com&t=140)

00:02:30 [So there is a schedule and canvas under the Microsoft MTA section, and there's a couple of things in there that's wanted to share with you.
](http://youtube.com&t=150)

00:02:40 [OK? Number one is you need to schedule your exam time with me, either from Monday, December six or Friday, December 10th.
](http://youtube.com&t=160)

00:02:50 [And some of you have done that already, and I appreciate that. I recommend that you take the exam on Monday this way if you don't pass it.
](http://youtube.com&t=170)

00:03:02 [And I've failed quite a few of these in my time, a fewer.
](http://youtube.com&t=182)

00:03:08 [So you'll be able to retake it on Friday if you don't pass it.
](http://youtube.com&t=188)

00:03:12 [All right. Just say it. So we give you two opportunities to take it.
](http://youtube.com&t=192)

00:03:17 [So here is the information right here. You all should have access to it.
](http://youtube.com&t=197)

00:03:23 [I want you to schedule your your exam with me and bye bye.
](http://youtube.com&t=203)

00:03:29 [If you have an inkling to take any of these other Microsoft certification exams,
](http://youtube.com&t=209)

00:03:36 [there is one on C-sharp and I know we have a c sharp programmer in the class here.
](http://youtube.com&t=216)

00:03:41 [So just note that not only can you take Python, but you can schedule all these others to and I'd be happy to provide them to you.
](http://youtube.com&t=221)

00:03:49 [Practice them for you in person a class on either Monday, December six or Friday, December 10.
](http://youtube.com&t=229)

00:03:56 [No cost to you. Just just know that these are free.
](http://youtube.com&t=236)

00:04:00 [There is no cost to you. So what you need to do is you need to like, like email me and say, Hey Bruce,
](http://youtube.com&t=240)

00:04:07 [I want to schedule h html on Monday night and I want to schedule a python at one o'clock, you know, just just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=247)

00:04:16 [All right, here's the instructions. It's all right here, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=256)

00:04:22 [And the next thing you want to do is I've some of you may have used this before, but we have access to practice tests.
](http://youtube.com&t=262)

00:04:31 [It's called G Metrics. They're the name of the company that makes it.
](http://youtube.com&t=271)

00:04:35 [So if you go through all these steps here, right,
](http://youtube.com&t=275)

00:04:39 [and you enter this magical code right here and select the Microsoft and then Python or whatever exam you want to study for,
](http://youtube.com&t=279)

00:04:50 [you'll be able to get to practice exams so you can do these practice exams and in practice mode where you get to see the answer after each question.
](http://youtube.com&t=290)

00:05:00 [Or you can go in a full on simulation mode where it's timed right and and stuff like that, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=300)

00:05:08 [So again, I provide you with the resources. Usually everyone who takes us passes it.
](http://youtube.com&t=308)

00:05:15 [Is it 100 percent of the material that I taught? You know, is it 90 percent?
](http://youtube.com&t=315)

00:05:22 [Yeah. Is the other 10 percent of the knowledge that you would need to know in some of these key metrics practice exams?
](http://youtube.com&t=322)

00:05:30 [Heck, yeah. All right. So that's why everyone usually passed it.
](http://youtube.com&t=330)

00:05:34 [And just so, you know, write these things, and I think you all know the story, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=334)

00:05:40 [If you go into. Go back to like the beginning of time here with module zero.
](http://youtube.com&t=340)

00:05:47 [I think I had like information about me and I've taken.
](http://youtube.com&t=347)

00:05:51 [All these various Microsoft certifications over time since I started it, Clark, I mean, I should know all this stuff because I teach a lot of it,
](http://youtube.com&t=351)

00:06:00 [but the ones that I did fail are ones that I don't have much experience with, which is like the Java programing language.
](http://youtube.com&t=360)

00:06:08 [That's the one I that kicked my butt a lot. So I had to learn Java, you know, over two months, and I finally, I finally passed it.
](http://youtube.com&t=368)

00:06:17 [And when you have these things, they also go on your LinkedIn and you know, and you can put them on your portfolio or wherever it may be.
](http://youtube.com&t=377)

00:06:26 [And I've said this before, every day I'll get a job request through LinkedIn for especially Python because it's such an in-demand language right now.
](http://youtube.com&t=386)

00:06:38 [And the other thing too, is LinkedIn has a little certification exam that you can take to prove your skills.
](http://youtube.com&t=398)

00:06:46 [And it was hard. Yeah, I wouldn't go take it right away because you can only take it twice within a six months time and after that, you have to wait.
](http://youtube.com&t=406)

00:06:56 [All right. So that's it on certifications, you know, are they required?
](http://youtube.com&t=416)

00:07:01 [No. Are they helpful? Yes. Are they good to have?
](http://youtube.com&t=421)

00:07:06 [Yeah. All right. Any questions before we get started?
](http://youtube.com&t=426)

00:07:12 [Any, any thing, anyone have any questions that I can answer.
](http://youtube.com&t=432)

00:07:23 [Nothing in the chat. All right. And for those of you who did send me the code words for the announcement that
](http://youtube.com&t=443)

00:07:32 [came out yesterday about watching that video or those videos before class?
](http://youtube.com&t=452)

00:07:38 [Thanks. Thanks for doing that. I think I got for people who replied back, So cool.
](http://youtube.com&t=458)

00:07:43 [And let's get started. If there's no questions, so let's get started and you can all see my screen right?
](http://youtube.com&t=463)

00:07:50 [Just checking, right? Yeah, you can see it. All right. Thanks, Brandon.
](http://youtube.com&t=470)

00:07:55 [So let's start off. Let's start off. Let me just call it the demo.
](http://youtube.com&t=475)

00:08:01 [Demo Dash one dot pi. OK, just like that. And let's.
](http://youtube.com&t=481)

00:08:08 [Pretend, well, let's pretend this is kind of those of you who watch the video, this is kind of what we're going to do.
](http://youtube.com&t=488)

00:08:16 [Let's pretend I keep saying it. Let's create some code where we can model a physical dye, a dye that you use for playing board games,
](http://youtube.com&t=496)

00:08:31 [whether it's a six sided dye or a hundreds thousands sided dye or a, you know, a 20 sided dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=511)

00:08:38 [I don't know what the gamers. I know my son.
](http://youtube.com&t=518)

00:08:42 [My son has this big dye with all. I don't know what game it is. Maybe you can tell me,
](http://youtube.com&t=522)

00:08:47 [but let's say we wanted to create a template where we could create a dye and then maybe we can create 10000 dye and we could roll them.
](http://youtube.com&t=527)

00:09:02 [We could do anything we wanted to do with the dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=542)

00:09:05 [Typically, it's you roll the dye, and that's kind of about it, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=545)

00:09:10 [So how would we go about creating a piece of software?
](http://youtube.com&t=550)

00:09:17 [Something called a class, a class or a template to model a multi-sided DI.
](http://youtube.com&t=557)

00:09:27 [OK, so let's do it. We're going to learn a new keyword in Python.
](http://youtube.com&t=567)

00:09:32 [And the key word is class. Class Class C L a ss all lowercase.
](http://youtube.com&t=572)

00:09:39 [And now you're going. Do you remember with the graphics library when you had like circle, it was uppercase, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=579)

00:09:45 [When you had graph, when it was uppercase, right when you had rectangle or polygon?
](http://youtube.com&t=585)

00:09:51 [Right. They all started with a capital letter. And that's when you define a class A template you or a blueprint.
](http://youtube.com&t=591)

00:10:00 [Right? You use a capital letter. So let's create a a class name called DI.
](http://youtube.com&t=600)

00:10:07 [No parentheses. None of that. And just a colon.
](http://youtube.com&t=607)

00:10:11 [Just like that. OK. Just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=611)

00:10:15 [So we're going to create a template, a cookie cutter that we're going to use to to fabricate die.
](http://youtube.com&t=615)

00:10:25 [This right in software in Python. OK, so here we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=625)

00:10:30 [I hit enter and it's like, it's like, All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=630)

00:10:36 [What goes inside of here, what goes inside of our class?
](http://youtube.com&t=636)

00:10:40 [Well, a whole bunch of things, right? A whole bunch of things.
](http://youtube.com&t=640)

00:10:43 [But when you created a graphics window, when you created a circle and you created a rectangle, a polygon.
](http://youtube.com&t=643)

00:10:50 [Any of these things? As soon as you created them?
](http://youtube.com&t=650)

00:10:54 [Right. Those are what we call.
](http://youtube.com&t=654)

00:10:58 [We instantiated them, right? We we we fabricated that right.
](http://youtube.com&t=658)

00:11:02 [So with a dye right with a dye?
](http://youtube.com&t=662)

00:11:06 [Does anyone want to tell me when we say, go to make a dye, make believe we have a factory in Vancouver here and we may die, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=666)

00:11:16 [So what are some properties of a dye?
](http://youtube.com&t=676)

00:11:21 [Anyone want to just belt some out to me?
](http://youtube.com&t=681)

00:11:24 [What are some things that when I look at it, dye, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=684)

00:11:29 [What can you describe some of its properties, right? I have brown hair looks gray, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=689)

00:11:34 [I'm five foot nine hundred ninety five pounds.
](http://youtube.com&t=694)

00:11:38 [Those are some properties right about Bruce, right? So what are some properties of a dye?
](http://youtube.com&t=698)

00:11:44 [Anybody. How many sides? It has number of sides, Common says.
](http://youtube.com&t=704)

00:11:49 [I'll I'll take that. So let me just do this.
](http://youtube.com&t=709)

00:11:55 [Uh, properties properties. OK, so the first thing is, no, actually, I'm not going to use my triple two three doing.
](http://youtube.com&t=715)

00:12:06 [Oops. Number of side. I have a plug in that extension that I need to turn off.
](http://youtube.com&t=726)

00:12:13 [Please hold. Please hold. I just turn this on doc.
](http://youtube.com&t=733)

00:12:22 [Pi. Can anyone see Python? Doc stream, yeah, I want to turn this off, although I could disable.
](http://youtube.com&t=742)

00:12:30 [Sorry about that reload. OK, so here we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=750)

00:12:36 [Number of signs. Properties, OK, what else, what else?
](http://youtube.com&t=756)

00:12:43 [Collins, right? Number of sites.
](http://youtube.com&t=763)

00:12:45 [Let's say you go to Fred Meyer and you buy or you go to the bat cave and you buy some dye and they're in a package, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=765)

00:12:54 [What do you see? What do you see when you look at that, that set of dye?
](http://youtube.com&t=774)

00:12:59 [What do you see anybody the same shape? OK, well, we'll leave that for now.
](http://youtube.com&t=779)

00:13:06 [OK, shape, Jojo says. What else? OK, what about the bears?
](http://youtube.com&t=786)

00:13:11 [Usually? OK, so they're packaged in pairs.
](http://youtube.com&t=791)

00:13:14 [But tell me about one day, Joshua. Tell me about one guy. Tell me about one guy when you look at it, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=794)

00:13:21 [If you know, how about six sizes depending on the deal you're looking at?
](http://youtube.com&t=801)

00:13:25 [Yes, that's right. So that's what Colin said. Number of sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=805)

00:13:29 [Let's say you look at the shelf and you see a package of dye, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=809)

00:13:34 [When you look at that package of dye, right, you'll notice that they have a certain number of sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=814)

00:13:40 [But what else do you see? What else do you see? No, that numbers right.
](http://youtube.com&t=820)

00:13:46 [So but those numbers, Gerri correspond to the site or when you look, does each dye, especially when, like when you roll a dye,
](http://youtube.com&t=826)

00:13:57 [how many values kind of dye have like during a game, like when you roll the dice,
](http://youtube.com&t=837)

00:14:03 [do you look at the side of the dye or do you look at the side facing up?
](http://youtube.com&t=843)

00:14:12 [Side face it, when you the side facing off and facing up is labeled a no.
](http://youtube.com&t=852)

00:14:18 [So what would you call that? What would you call that that that?
](http://youtube.com&t=858)

00:14:22 [Would it be the the the value? What do you call like when I rolled of five, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=862)

00:14:29 [If I roll of five, what do you call that? Five? Can we call it value is a technical term for it?
](http://youtube.com&t=869)

00:14:38 [We could call it a value because that's that's what you get. All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=878)

00:14:41 [So we'll call it a value. I'm going to just not use the shape pronounce just because I'll take it a little while.
](http://youtube.com&t=881)

00:14:48 [But is it fair to say that the dye that we need to fabricate has a certain number of sides and it's going to have a value, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=888)

00:15:01 [Whether it's what the value is in the package, when Jerry is looking at it on the shelf,
](http://youtube.com&t=901)

00:15:06 [or it's when Ben is using it to play a game with with his friends, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=906)

00:15:12 [We could also add in here color. Right? The dye has a certain color, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=912)

00:15:18 [Maybe. I don't know. I don't think that's necessary right now. Let's just stick with we make dye that have a certain number of sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=918)

00:15:27 [And when we either package them in, you know,
](http://youtube.com&t=927)

00:15:31 [a box or whatever that there is either a value showing on the dye or when Ben uses them in his game, they they have a value.
](http://youtube.com&t=931)

00:15:42 [So those two things are the same.
](http://youtube.com&t=942)

00:15:44 [So how do we create in the software a dye that has, I don't know, six sides will go with four now and has a default value.
](http://youtube.com&t=944)

00:15:56 [Let's just say we have that single dot when we package our dye in our factory in Vancouver,
](http://youtube.com&t=956)

00:16:02 [all the dye are placed in the packaging the same way, with the number one showing by default.
](http://youtube.com&t=962)

00:16:10 [OK. Let's just go with with that for now. So again, how do we construct this dye in software?
](http://youtube.com&t=970)

00:16:17 [Well, there is something we need to do.
](http://youtube.com&t=977)

00:16:21 [And you remember from last week when we created these functions,
](http://youtube.com&t=981)

00:16:27 [we are going to create a special type of function called a constructor constructor function,
](http://youtube.com&t=987)

00:16:34 [which gets run ran when we create a new dye in our software.
](http://youtube.com&t=994)

00:16:42 [OK. So what we do is we create a special name called Double actually what this is called.
](http://youtube.com&t=1002)

00:16:50 [Let me just do this right here. And then just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=1010)

00:16:54 [Now this is weird, OK? This is really weird. It's a reserve word in Python, and it it's two underscores the word init,
](http://youtube.com&t=1014)

00:17:05 [which stands for initialize and then two more underscores and then a set of parentheses I'll call in.
](http://youtube.com&t=1025)

00:17:14 [OK. And we usually say for these double underscore, as we'll say, Dunder Dundar, not Dunder Mifflin Dunder double underscore.
](http://youtube.com&t=1034)

00:17:25 [And what this says is when you create, when you construct, when you initialize a new dye, we need to do the following.
](http://youtube.com&t=1045)

00:17:35 [OK, so check it out. We put this word in here called self.
](http://youtube.com&t=1055)

00:17:40 [And remember, we're dealing with objects. They have the ability to to know things about them, and they can also do things.
](http://youtube.com&t=1060)

00:17:50 [So our dye, when we create it, it's going to say, Hey, self.
](http://youtube.com&t=1070)

00:17:56 [OK, what's your value? What what's your value and what's your number of sites?
](http://youtube.com&t=1076)

00:18:03 [So now we're going to say, Hey, self. What's your value and let's set all of our die to have a default value of one?
](http://youtube.com&t=1083)

00:18:12 [OK. Now again, I know some of this is highly, you know, just way out in left field right now, but just stick with me.
](http://youtube.com&t=1092)

00:18:21 [So by default, when we create a new die or a new object or a new template, right, which we're doing here or by a class may just fix us up here.
](http://youtube.com&t=1101)

00:18:31 [We say we create the class name, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1111)

00:18:37 [I called it die uppercase.
](http://youtube.com&t=1117)

00:18:40 [We create our constructor function, constructor function and this get run as soon as we create a new die, which we haven't done yet.
](http://youtube.com&t=1120)

00:18:50 [We're just creating the template for what happens when we create a new die, just like we did with a new graph when a new circle, a new rectangle.
](http://youtube.com&t=1130)

00:19:00 [It had a constructor which said, Hey, when when you let me carry on.
](http://youtube.com&t=1140)

00:19:05 [So when we create the die, we're setting itself to have a value one and we're setting the number of sides to six.
](http://youtube.com&t=1145)

00:19:14 [We're going to stick with a six sided die. OK, so believe it or not, believe it or not,
](http://youtube.com&t=1154)

00:19:21 [what we've done here is we have created a template to make six sided die that have a default value of one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1161)

00:19:33 [OK, now. Just take that in for a second.
](http://youtube.com&t=1173)

00:19:37 [Okay, take that in, and it'll make a lot more sense as soon as I construct my first day.
](http://youtube.com&t=1177)

00:19:43 [Can I check it? Here we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=1183)

00:19:48 [Here we go. Let's just call it die one variable name.
](http://youtube.com&t=1188)

00:19:52 [Die one. Just like you did with Circle, you created Circle one, Circle two or i1 I two, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1192)

00:19:58 [I just call them create a variable called die one. And I said, Hey, die one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1198)

00:20:03 [I want you to create a new die. Just like that. Just create a new die, just like we did with graph one and other things.
](http://youtube.com&t=1203)

00:20:11 [There is no parameters yet for our die.
](http://youtube.com&t=1211)

00:20:15 [We're just if you create a die, just like I did here, we're saying, Hey, hey, hey, class,
](http://youtube.com&t=1215)

00:20:21 [create a new die that has a default value of one and six sides and store it in this variable called die one by one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1221)

00:20:32 [Now everyone's like, All right, if I print out the type of die one, do you think it's going to be a a string?
](http://youtube.com&t=1232)

00:20:41 [Be an integer or c an object on a integer B string C object?
](http://youtube.com&t=1241)

00:20:51 [What do you think? Line 13 is going to print out.
](http://youtube.com&t=1251)

00:20:56 [Take a there's no wrong guesses here. Somebody take a guess. Object, I mean, string, an integer string or object.
](http://youtube.com&t=1256)

00:21:05 [I think in strength. So, Jojo, to your point.
](http://youtube.com&t=1265)

00:21:11 [We have won a default value of one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1271)

00:21:15 [That's that's that little snake eyes staring at us in on the dye and the dye has six sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=1275)

00:21:22 [So could we represent both these bits of information as a string?
](http://youtube.com&t=1282)

00:21:28 [Or is it like when we created a circle, the circle had a center point and the circle had a radius,
](http://youtube.com&t=1288)

00:21:38 [so which was an object, so integer string or object?
](http://youtube.com&t=1298)

00:21:45 [You're going to stick with your answer, Joshua, what do you want to change it? You want to buy a vowel?
](http://youtube.com&t=1305)

00:21:57 [Everybody I didn't think about. All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=1317)

00:22:00 [So when we created a circle was a circle, an integer, a string or an object.
](http://youtube.com&t=1320)

00:22:09 [And I just want to know it's an object, right? It's an object, so we're doing the same thing.
](http://youtube.com&t=1329)

00:22:15 [We've created our own object that we made right here, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1335)

00:22:22 [And if I print out, it's tight. It says, in fact, that it is made.
](http://youtube.com&t=1342)

00:22:31 [Of a die, so this believe it or not, this is telling you that this variable die one is an object and in fact it is.
](http://youtube.com&t=1351)

00:22:41 [It is a die. It is a die, which is which is an object.
](http://youtube.com&t=1361)

00:22:45 [It's not a string. It's not an integer, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1365)

00:22:48 [It's an object. Because Jojo, check it out.
](http://youtube.com&t=1368)

00:22:52 [I can then say print die one dot, just like we did with the graphics library.
](http://youtube.com&t=1372)

00:22:59 [And look what we get here size and value. So let's just do sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=1379)

00:23:05 [And now we're going to print out right sides. Sides is a prop.
](http://youtube.com&t=1385)

00:23:12 [Remember when we did like? I'm trying to remember an example where we just used a property like this, but let me just run it so you can see it.
](http://youtube.com&t=1392)

00:23:24 [And now it's telling me that that dye that we created has six signs that Dye one has six sides and that dye one has a value its current value looks.
](http://youtube.com&t=1404)

00:23:41 [I can't type today. Its value is going to be.
](http://youtube.com&t=1421)

00:23:46 [One. Okay, now we've created a model of a die in software, now we've created one die with it for our program to use.
](http://youtube.com&t=1426)

00:23:56 [But if we want to create a second, die a second, die here, I'm just going to copy this code, copy this code.
](http://youtube.com&t=1436)

00:24:04 [Put it here and change die one to die to.
](http://youtube.com&t=1444)

00:24:14 [Right, I mean, just put a print here. Die, too.
](http://youtube.com&t=1454)

00:24:19 [And I'll print. A. A print die one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1459)

00:24:29 [So you can see that we've created. Today.
](http://youtube.com&t=1469)

00:24:36 [Although one second, I think they did it. Here it is.
](http://youtube.com&t=1476)

00:24:40 [So we've created die one right here. Let me show me sorry, this is a little theaters die one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1480)

00:24:48 [It's made of a die. It has six sides. The current value is one in the package.
](http://youtube.com&t=1488)

00:24:54 [Then we have a die to, which is made for a die, has six sides and has a face value of one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1494)

00:25:04 [So using not really take one. So using this one set of code right here, using this one set of code, I've created two dice.
](http://youtube.com&t=1504)

00:25:17 [Two dice, right? Two dice. Two dice.
](http://youtube.com&t=1517)

00:25:22 [I can go on and on and I can create other die using this, but that's not going to be any fun.
](http://youtube.com&t=1522)

00:25:29 [And when we do things like this, we're having to create variables for each one of those die, which is probably not a good thing.
](http://youtube.com&t=1529)

00:25:40 [You learned a few weeks ago about list and how a list can be like a bag of dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=1540)

00:25:46 [It can have multiple dice inside of it. All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=1546)

00:25:50 [So let's just put this aside for now and let me create another demo that's going to expand on this die a little bit.
](http://youtube.com&t=1550)

00:26:01 [So I'm going to do control and I'm going to paste in the code.
](http://youtube.com&t=1561)

00:26:05 [I'm going to save it. I'm going to call it Demo Dash to.
](http://youtube.com&t=1565)

00:26:10 [Don't. I think. Demo Test two PI.
](http://youtube.com&t=1570)

00:26:15 [And there's my die. There it is. There is my template to make die.
](http://youtube.com&t=1575)

00:26:20 [Now this is all well and good. If we just want to be able to create like one die or, you know, a million die.
](http://youtube.com&t=1580)

00:26:31 [Okay. So what we want to be able to do is to be able to give our guy something that a real die would have.
](http://youtube.com&t=1591)

00:26:44 [And when you're playing a game, what's the one thing you do with a die?
](http://youtube.com&t=1604)

00:26:49 [What do you do with it, you? Roll it, you roll it right.
](http://youtube.com&t=1609)

00:26:56 [So how do we give our die that we're creating?
](http://youtube.com&t=1616)

00:27:01 [Thanks, Robert. By the way, how do we create a method or a way that our die can do something?
](http://youtube.com&t=1621)

00:27:09 [And in this case, it's how could we make it so we can roll it via software and by rolling it?
](http://youtube.com&t=1629)

00:27:18 [What is the one property of that die that's going to change?
](http://youtube.com&t=1638)

00:27:23 [It's not going to change and morph into having more or less sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=1643)

00:27:28 [But what's going to be the one thing that changes when after we roll a die anybody?
](http://youtube.com&t=1648)

00:27:37 [What's going to be under my eyes? Yeah, but what what?
](http://youtube.com&t=1657)

00:27:43 [That but what what property of that guy gets randomized? What what property on line three or four of my code gets randomized?
](http://youtube.com&t=1663)

00:27:55 [Which property there? Besides the assures, so when I roll the die, the number of side change or does the value change Jojo?
](http://youtube.com&t=1675)

00:28:05 [But I guess like the side that you're meeting. So yeah, the the value, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1685)

00:28:12 [That's the the the number of facing up, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1692)

00:28:15 [So we're playing. Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
](http://youtube.com&t=1695)

00:28:19 [So what we want to do is we want to define a new method called roll.
](http://youtube.com&t=1699)

00:28:25 [Let's just call it roll, roll roll. And then we're going to say, Hey, self, hey di you, I'm talking to you.
](http://youtube.com&t=1705)

00:28:34 [Roll yourself, right? And then I'm going to say, like Jojo said, we need to be able to now generate a random number, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1714)

00:28:47 [Because Ben is playing this game and he's writing a software game and he rolls that AI, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1727)

00:28:53 [So he's going to say, Hey, software guy that we haven't created in this demo yet.
](http://youtube.com&t=1733)

00:28:58 [I need you to generate a random number between one and six, because that's the number of sites that you have.
](http://youtube.com&t=1738)

00:29:09 [So here I go. Ready. I'm going to say, Hey, self.
](http://youtube.com&t=1749)

00:29:15 [I need you to set your value to. Some random number between one and six.
](http://youtube.com&t=1755)

00:29:26 [So anyone does anyone realize what functionality we need to bring into our code at this point to help us generate a random number, I hear somebody.
](http://youtube.com&t=1766)

00:29:40 [We need to import random. Yes, Ben.
](http://youtube.com&t=1780)

00:29:44 [So Ben is like, Hey, Bruce from the random library from random import rand.
](http://youtube.com&t=1784)

00:29:53 [Right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1793)

00:29:53 [Because Rand gives us and we've used this over and over again and write a set of random integers, random whole numbers inclusively between two things.
](http://youtube.com&t=1793)

00:30:03 [So could we not write do this?
](http://youtube.com&t=1803)

00:30:06 [Could we say Hey rand and generate a number, generate a number from one to one comma one to the number of sides that this particular guy has?
](http://youtube.com&t=1806)

00:30:22 [I didn't order code six because I'm saying, Hey di, look at yourself.
](http://youtube.com&t=1822)

00:30:26 [How many sides do you have? How many sides you have?
](http://youtube.com&t=1826)

00:30:30 [Look at yourself and the diocese. Oh, I got six.
](http://youtube.com&t=1830)

00:30:33 [So what it's going to do now is going to generate a random number between one and six and tell itself that that is its new value.
](http://youtube.com&t=1833)

00:30:44 [Just just like that. OK. Just like that. So what I can do in my code now, I'm out, didn't it all the way?
](http://youtube.com&t=1844)

00:30:53 [I have my di template and my dye template has two properties, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1853)

00:30:58 [These are properties. Let me label these properties right.
](http://youtube.com&t=1858)

00:31:04 [And this down here is a method, right? Remember the when we took an object in the graphics library and we told it to draw itself, draw is a method.
](http://youtube.com&t=1864)

00:31:17 [Notice the method. Start with lowercase letters, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1877)

00:31:21 [The class name starts with a capital letter, and we're not returning anything.
](http://youtube.com&t=1881)

00:31:29 [We're just saying, Hey, look at yourself, change the value of yourself from one to the number of sides that you have.
](http://youtube.com&t=1889)

00:31:39 [So let's go create our die one again. We're going to say die one equals create a new die, just create a new day.
](http://youtube.com&t=1899)

00:31:46 [And then we're going to say, Hey, die one actually print out, Hey, die one.
](http://youtube.com&t=1906)

00:31:51 [Print out the number of sides. Print out your value.
](http://youtube.com&t=1911)

00:31:56 [Print out your value. Tell me what your value is. And by default, that value is one because we haven't told our die to roll itself in code yet.
](http://youtube.com&t=1916)

00:32:06 [We just fabricated instantiated a new die.
](http://youtube.com&t=1926)

00:32:11 [So here it is, right down here. It's one we have one as the default value showing in our die when we created it.
](http://youtube.com&t=1931)

00:32:21 [So now if I say, Hey, die one. Hey, day one, I want you to take yourself and role yourself role as a method role is something that a guy can do.
](http://youtube.com&t=1941)

00:32:35 [It's not a prop., it's something that a guy can do.
](http://youtube.com&t=1955)

00:32:39 [And now if I just copy this line of code again, if I copy this line of code again,
](http://youtube.com&t=1959)

00:32:46 [hey, day one, what is your value after we asked you to roll yourself ready?
](http://youtube.com&t=1966)

00:32:52 [Let me run it. Do I did I point out there it is.
](http://youtube.com&t=1972)

00:32:57 [So one in one? Let me run it again. One in six.
](http://youtube.com&t=1977)

00:33:03 [One in five. One in four. One in six. One in five. One in two.
](http://youtube.com&t=1983)

00:33:07 [One and one one. And two one in five one in three six.
](http://youtube.com&t=1987)

00:33:11 [So do you see how we were able to create in the software?
](http://youtube.com&t=1991)

00:33:18 [A cookie cutter template to create a day when we created it, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=1998)

00:33:24 [This is a code that gets run when we do this line.
](http://youtube.com&t=2004)

00:33:28 [12. It gives itself a default value of one and six sides, and then we're asking our dye that we created to roll itself.
](http://youtube.com&t=2008)

00:33:43 [And we're setting its value that it knows it is, this is what we call an instance variable.
](http://youtube.com&t=2023)

00:33:51 [It kind of in this instance where we created Die One, it knows what value it's set to and that is one in fixed.
](http://youtube.com&t=2031)

00:34:01 [OK, but when we roll it, we're changing that value to be some number between one and the number of sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=2041)

00:34:12 [That particular dye has. What are you thinking about classes so far?
](http://youtube.com&t=2052)

00:34:25 [What what kind of questions are coming to mind kind of abstract?
](http://youtube.com&t=2065)

00:34:29 [Is this a very abstract concept? A little bit.
](http://youtube.com&t=2069)

00:34:43 [And then like. Well, I. Just because you're putting everything into one like what we were doing before, but now it's all into one group.
](http://youtube.com&t=2083)

00:34:53 [A group. So what Robert's referring to is, Bruce, you have these functions here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2093)

00:34:58 [Right? One of them has this weird name called Thunder and Thunder, and this other one is a regular one that you kind of recognize.
](http://youtube.com&t=2098)

00:35:07 [But they're all grouped together under this.
](http://youtube.com&t=2107)

00:35:12 [Class that is known as die. Right?
](http://youtube.com&t=2112)

00:35:15 [So, Robert? Yes, to that point.
](http://youtube.com&t=2115)

00:35:19 [A class is defined of a bunch of functions because again, going back to the graphics library when you created a new rectangle,
](http://youtube.com&t=2119)

00:35:29 [you could set it fill, you could set its outline, you could clone it.
](http://youtube.com&t=2129)

00:35:35 [There's a whole bunch of things that a rectangle was able to do,
](http://youtube.com&t=2135)

00:35:40 [and what we're doing is we're just mimicking that whole concept we learned with objects and the graphics library.
](http://youtube.com&t=2140)

00:35:49 [By creating our own objects that have properties right and are able to do what we need a thing to do and will do way more of these other than to die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2149)

00:36:03 [But Robert, does that help a little bit clarifying what's going on?
](http://youtube.com&t=2163)

00:36:07 [Yeah, it makes sense. But then like around like what?
](http://youtube.com&t=2167)

00:36:11 [I guess Line 11, would you normally put that in the main two? Yeah.
](http://youtube.com&t=2171)

00:36:15 [So Ben was Ben was on my shoulder and he's like, Bruce, you should really put that code in the main here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2175)

00:36:22 [Let me just do that. Is that better?
](http://youtube.com&t=2182)

00:36:29 [And that makes sense now. Yeah. I'm sorry.
](http://youtube.com&t=2189)

00:36:33 [Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. So and on that we were to change the value and the sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=2193)

00:36:42 [Would we have to create a new class? No.
](http://youtube.com&t=2202)

00:36:45 [So all right. So right now, our class is pretty boring, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=2205)

00:36:51 [It only creates six sided die with a default value of one.
](http://youtube.com&t=2211)

00:36:55 [Right? Now what if Ben's like, I want a 20 sided die?
](http://youtube.com&t=2215)

00:37:00 [OK, ready. Let me run the code. Let me run the code, and the default value is one, and when we roll it, it gets 14.
](http://youtube.com&t=2220)

00:37:11 [Two, 10, 14, C, so by just changing the template.
](http://youtube.com&t=2231)

00:37:19 [Let's say we want the default value now to be. 20.
](http://youtube.com&t=2239)

00:37:23 [Right when you when we manufacture or die and we box them up and we put them all together,
](http://youtube.com&t=2243)

00:37:30 [the default face that showing is the number 20 right or twenty two.
](http://youtube.com&t=2250)

00:37:34 [I don't know what the multi-sided dial look like, but now see how the default value of our dye is always 20.
](http://youtube.com&t=2254)

00:37:42 [And it's randomly generating a number between one and 20 when we roll the dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=2262)

00:37:49 [OK, Joshua are thinking about like, if we create more dye, well, we're going to get what I want by two.
](http://youtube.com&t=2269)

00:37:57 [Yeah, we're going to create. We're going to create a bag of dye, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=2277)

00:38:02 [So not that this has this is not a bag of dye, it's a bag of coins, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=2282)

00:38:09 [So I know you have like these bags where you put your dye in, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=2289)

00:38:13 [So how could we like write software that creates this bag of dye and a whole bunch of dye inside of it?
](http://youtube.com&t=2293)

00:38:21 [Right? And that's what I'm going to show you next. Before we before we carry on.
](http://youtube.com&t=2301)

00:38:26 [All right. So again, let me just go back to one here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2306)

00:38:31 [And even if we just make this a one sided dye, you can see here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2311)

00:38:37 [Let the default value is always one, right? The default value is always one.
](http://youtube.com&t=2317)

00:38:44 [And then when we roll it, it gets a new value between one and the number of sides that are available to that die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2324)

00:38:52 [And if I do this just so you can see loss here, I'll say.
](http://youtube.com&t=2332)

00:38:58 [Original. Value. And then I'll put here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2338)

00:39:09 [After rolled. Now when I run it.
](http://youtube.com&t=2349)

00:39:18 [One and then five. One an ABC.
](http://youtube.com&t=2358)

00:39:31 [OK, now let me just let me there's a couple more things we need to do here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2371)

00:39:39 [This is great. We've created one die. How boring, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=2379)

00:39:43 [So the question becomes right, how can we create is anyone?
](http://youtube.com&t=2383)

00:39:49 [Can gamers who use die? How many does a game typically have one die?
](http://youtube.com&t=2389)

00:39:54 [Or sometimes you have multiple die? That sometimes has multiple die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2394)

00:40:00 [All right. So how many die would you have? Well, and one of the games they have, like one of the main guys that we have is like spies.
](http://youtube.com&t=2400)

00:40:11 [OK, so let's go with say, Lindsay has been hired by a local company to write a pilot program,
](http://youtube.com&t=2411)

00:40:19 [and she needs to be able to simulate a game that has a bag that contains five dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=2419)

00:40:28 [And how many sides do those dye have? I'm just curious.
](http://youtube.com&t=2428)

00:40:34 [Is excited, 20 excited. Well, like for each star, I would be like six to seven on that side.
](http://youtube.com&t=2434)

00:40:47 [OK, let's just go with this that we need to create five die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2447)

00:40:54 [And we need to be able to, like, take those die in my hand,
](http://youtube.com&t=2454)

00:40:57 [shake my hand and then roll the die out on to the table and I can then read all of their their values.
](http://youtube.com&t=2457)

00:41:07 [Okay, so check this out. Actually, I'm going to go on the Demo three.
](http://youtube.com&t=2467)

00:41:11 [I'm just going to take all this code and copy it into Demo three, just so I don't mess too much stuff up.
](http://youtube.com&t=2471)

00:41:19 [Let me go. Demo three here. Demo three Dog Pie.
](http://youtube.com&t=2479)

00:41:24 [Paste in that code, right? And now I'm going to operate a little bit.
](http://youtube.com&t=2484)

00:41:28 [Okay. So I'm not I'm just going to cut this out for now, and let's create a variable called bag of.
](http://youtube.com&t=2488)

00:41:39 [Dice a bag of dice, bag of dice.
](http://youtube.com&t=2499)

00:41:44 [And if you remember in coding, when we want to put multiple things into a single variable, we create an empty list,
](http://youtube.com&t=2504)

00:41:56 [an empty list and you saw me do this when we learned about lists, how I could take,
](http://youtube.com&t=2516)

00:42:02 [you know, a bunch of circles and put the circles into a list and then draw those circles.
](http://youtube.com&t=2522)

00:42:08 [So here is my my empty bag of dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=2528)

00:42:12 [There's nothing in here right now. All right. So how can we programmatically in software create a new dye?
](http://youtube.com&t=2532)

00:42:21 [And add it and place it into our bag of dice.
](http://youtube.com&t=2541)

00:42:26 [OK, so let's do it. How do we do something five times what the programing concept?
](http://youtube.com&t=2546)

00:42:33 [You're sick and tired of hearing me say, What do we do when we need to do something five times?
](http://youtube.com&t=2553)

00:42:42 [Loop it. Yeah, loop it counted loop for Iron Range of five.
](http://youtube.com&t=2562)

00:42:47 [We want to put five dye into our bag, so what we can now do is we can say, Hey, bag of dice, I want you to append to you.
](http://youtube.com&t=2567)

00:43:02 [A new die just like that. That's weird. So online, 15, I'm saying, hey, bag of dice,
](http://youtube.com&t=2582)

00:43:12 [I want you to append because that's how we glue and place new things into our bag of tie into our list and then instead of a string and integer,
](http://youtube.com&t=2592)

00:43:23 [I'm just saying, Hey, create a new dye just like that. Just die open, close parentheses, just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=2603)

00:43:33 [And now, if I print out just at the end here, if I say print out what is the length of our bag of dice,
](http://youtube.com&t=2613)

00:43:40 [which is going to tell us how many things are in that list, if I run this now, I should have five.
](http://youtube.com&t=2620)

00:43:49 [Die in that back. Okay, there they are. I can't I'm only pointing out the length right now.
](http://youtube.com&t=2629)

00:43:56 [I haven't even rolled the dice or done anything yet.
](http://youtube.com&t=2636)

00:44:01 [But I want to just break this down for you just a little bit easier because I think when we create a new die and we place it into this bad egg,
](http://youtube.com&t=2641)

00:44:12 [I'm thinking That's. Well, let me let me let me see if I can explain.
](http://youtube.com&t=2652)

00:44:18 [So what I'm going to do here is it's going to say lowercase dye equals dye just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=2658)

00:44:23 [OK. There it is. There it is. I created a variable called dye lowercase.
](http://youtube.com&t=2663)

00:44:30 [Die, and I said, create a new die and hold on to it as a bat, as a variable called die,
](http://youtube.com&t=2670)

00:44:38 [and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Hey, die, roll yourself before we stick you in the back, hey, die, roll yourself.
](http://youtube.com&t=2678)

00:44:48 [And then we're just going to add into the bag. That roll die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2688)

00:44:55 [OK. So instead of having a bag of dye that just has all the values the same because when I stick a guy in here,
](http://youtube.com&t=2695)

00:45:02 [it's going to it's going to roll around, right? It's just it's not going to be one.
](http://youtube.com&t=2702)

00:45:07 [So before we stick that guy into the back, we're going to roll it.
](http://youtube.com&t=2707)

00:45:12 [We could roll it a thousand times if we wanted to using a loop.
](http://youtube.com&t=2712)

00:45:16 [But here's what I'm going to create a dye from the dye class.
](http://youtube.com&t=2716)

00:45:25 [Roll the dye. Append the dye into the list just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=2725)

00:45:35 [OK, so here's what I printed out the length print out the number of dye objects in the bag just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=2735)

00:45:47 [But now how do I see the value?
](http://youtube.com&t=2747)

00:45:54 [Of each guy, how do I see the value of each day?
](http://youtube.com&t=2754)

00:45:59 [This variable contains a list of the five die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2759)

00:46:04 [So being what we've learned in this class, could I say for every I'll just call it for every.
](http://youtube.com&t=2764)

00:46:12 [Yeah, we'll call it die in the bag of dice for every.
](http://youtube.com&t=2772)

00:46:19 [Every guy that's in that bag of dice, could I say print out died dot value?
](http://youtube.com&t=2779)

00:46:25 [Can I say, Hey, hey, Don, what's your current value? And if I run this right and I'll go back and comment and the second if I run this.
](http://youtube.com&t=2785)

00:46:35 [You can see here now we have five, five five four one five.
](http://youtube.com&t=2795)

00:46:39 [If I create another bag of dye. Five, six, three, six, four, five five.
](http://youtube.com&t=2799)

00:46:47 [We're getting all these different value of as we're manufacturing, you know, bags of dice on our assembly line.
](http://youtube.com&t=2807)

00:46:56 [They're they're coming out with all these five dye because that's how many Lindsey said we needed in each bag.
](http://youtube.com&t=2816)

00:47:03 [But if we dumped out the dove from each one?
](http://youtube.com&t=2823)

00:47:07 [There they are there the the dye coming out differently each time.
](http://youtube.com&t=2827)

00:47:14 [And if we needed to create a set of dye that has like a bag of dye or a package that contains 100 dyes, we just change our loop to 100.
](http://youtube.com&t=2834)

00:47:28 [And now we get 100 dye of all different rolled values, a bag of dyes or packaged dyes whenever we want to call it.
](http://youtube.com&t=2848)

00:47:37 [Just like just like that. So let me let me break this down to iterate.
](http://youtube.com&t=2857)

00:47:45 [Loop right through each item and list.
](http://youtube.com&t=2865)

00:47:52 [Print out objects, value property.
](http://youtube.com&t=2872)

00:48:00 [So here is our completed beginner way to create.
](http://youtube.com&t=2880)

00:48:08 [A dye that contains six sides by default, the value of that dye is one.
](http://youtube.com&t=2888)

00:48:15 [We created a list, an empty list. Create empty list.
](http://youtube.com&t=2895)

00:48:25 [Loop one 100 times. And there you go.
](http://youtube.com&t=2905)

00:48:29 [We create a new dye. We roll that dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=2909)

00:48:34 [We then print out the length and then we iterate through the bag of dice one guy at a time and we print out its value.
](http://youtube.com&t=2914)

00:48:46 [How many different variable names did we create?
](http://youtube.com&t=2926)

00:48:51 [For the die. None. I mean, one, we only have this bag of dice.
](http://youtube.com&t=2931)

00:48:58 [So remember that the purpose of the list is to hold multiple things.
](http://youtube.com&t=2938)

00:49:03 [In this case, the things are not integers, they're not strings, but they're die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2943)

00:49:10 [And the two things that each guy has is a face value.
](http://youtube.com&t=2950)

00:49:15 [And a set number of sides. So this is kind of neat until right until.
](http://youtube.com&t=2955)

00:49:28 [Nathan, our boss says, you know, this is all well and good, we're able to create new dye, but I don't always want six sided die.
](http://youtube.com&t=2968)

00:49:38 [I may want a 20 sided die or a four sided die or a million sided right.
](http://youtube.com&t=2978)

00:49:47 [Okay, so we're going to be looking how to handle these types of things, because right now everything is hardcoded right here.
](http://youtube.com&t=2987)

00:49:58 [It's hard coded. We're saying when you instantiate a new dye, when you create a new dye one, and it's exciting any and all times.
](http://youtube.com&t=2998)

00:50:08 [Okay? You hear me say this each class, we don't write a lot of code, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3008)

00:50:22 [But it's these concepts. And if you're going into web development, when we start talking to databases,
](http://youtube.com&t=3022)

00:50:28 [you know we're going to use this same type of concept where we connect to a database and then we're going to get a whole bunch of maybe.
](http://youtube.com&t=3028)

00:50:38 [You know, social media post back and then we're going to, you know, be able to do things with those social media posts, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3038)

00:50:46 [Get the count, the count of likes that the number of comments, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3046)

00:50:51 [So a post right is an object.
](http://youtube.com&t=3051)

00:50:55 [Then it contains information about the number of likes, the number of comments, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3055)

00:51:00 [Whether it has images and we can it, we can do things with that particular, you know, social media post.
](http://youtube.com&t=3060)

00:51:07 [But that's what we'll save that for another day. So let's move on now and just step in through here and we're going to copy all this code again.
](http://youtube.com&t=3067)

00:51:18 [Copy all this code again. But we are now going to create a code.
](http://youtube.com&t=3078)

00:51:26 [That's going to not have a hard coded.
](http://youtube.com&t=3086)

00:51:31 [Face value or a hard coded number of sides?
](http://youtube.com&t=3091)

00:51:35 [Okay, so how do we do this?
](http://youtube.com&t=3095)

00:51:39 [How do we let me just check the time here? 10:53. How do we how do we how do we do this?
](http://youtube.com&t=3099)

00:51:49 [So what we do is when we create or instantiate a new dye.
](http://youtube.com&t=3109)

00:51:56 [We're going to add some parameters after herself, we're going to say, Hey,
](http://youtube.com&t=3116)

00:52:00 [I want you to have a default value of something and I want you to have a certain number of sides because when we create this new dye,
](http://youtube.com&t=3120)

00:52:10 [we are going to specify what we want the face value to be and the number of sites.
](http://youtube.com&t=3130)

00:52:19 [So what we're going to do here now is we're going to change this from a one to that variable that we're passing in called value.
](http://youtube.com&t=3139)

00:52:27 [And we're going to change this to the number of sides you want me to manufacture or instantiate or create that dye with.
](http://youtube.com&t=3147)

00:52:37 [So now you see that when we construct a new dye, it's got this self parameter here that always has to be there.
](http://youtube.com&t=3157)

00:52:47 [We're not going to do anything, but it's just a thing of the language that says this parameter needs to say,
](http://youtube.com&t=3167)

00:52:54 [Hey, self, look at yourself in the mirror. All right, cool. I know who I am.
](http://youtube.com&t=3174)

00:52:58 [And then it's going to get a value. And the number of sites?
](http://youtube.com&t=3178)

00:53:03 [OK. But when we're creating our die right here on Line 15, we now need to say how many what you want,
](http://youtube.com&t=3183)

00:53:12 [the default value to be and all that make it one here.
](http://youtube.com&t=3192)

00:53:17 [And how many sides do you want? The die to be will make it 100.
](http://youtube.com&t=3197)

00:53:21 [OK. So does anyone see the problem?
](http://youtube.com&t=3201)

00:53:26 [It's not a problem where this when we create this new dye work, we're saying that it requires three things stealth value inside.
](http://youtube.com&t=3206)

00:53:37 [But you start me. Just add to right here the value and the number of sites.
](http://youtube.com&t=3217)

00:53:43 [Now I want you to know that this is implied where we don't we don't specify self here on Line 15.
](http://youtube.com&t=3223)

00:53:52 [You don't do that won't work if it's just a weird thing in the language that's going to screw with your mind.
](http://youtube.com&t=3232)

00:54:00 [So when I run this now, I'm going to create a dye that's going to have a default value of one and 100 sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=3240)

00:54:09 [So check this out. Here we go. We actually I want to cut this number down just so you know, from one hundred to five.
](http://youtube.com&t=3249)

00:54:19 [Let's go back to five. I'm going to create a bag of five dye that are going to be default value of one and have 100 sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=3259)

00:54:30 [So here I go. There they are five, seventy five, eighty four, eighty two,
](http://youtube.com&t=3270)

00:54:37 [eight and seventy six and now when when Nathan says no, we need to make a run now of 100000 sided die.
](http://youtube.com&t=3277)

00:54:49 [Cool. There they are. They are there different die coming out?
](http://youtube.com&t=3289)

00:54:56 [Why are there six numbers? One is the length that's coming out, right, right here.
](http://youtube.com&t=3296)

00:55:04 [Oh, OK. Yeah. So let me get rid of that. So you can see.
](http://youtube.com&t=3304)

00:55:09 [So now I'm creating a bag of five dye that are 100000 sides.
](http://youtube.com&t=3309)

00:55:14 [And I did not hard code into my into my class anything any hard, hard numbers like one or four or five when I create this dye right here.
](http://youtube.com&t=3314)

00:55:32 [I'm passing in. The default value I want it to be and the number of sides I want that die to be.
](http://youtube.com&t=3332)

00:55:46 [OK. We're at the end of the quarter, you have to imagine that the content gets a little bit more tricky, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3346)

00:55:56 [And this is, you know, it's not easy stuff to comprehend.
](http://youtube.com&t=3356)

00:56:01 [So I think we'll do some, some some more examples instead of die.
](http://youtube.com&t=3361)

00:56:06 [Maybe we'll do stuff with cars or animals or players or just about anything, any physical object that exists we can represent as a class.
](http://youtube.com&t=3366)

00:56:19 [Okay. Thank.
](http://youtube.com&t=3379)

00:56:31 [So again. We didn't create separate Barrack that values for the five type of variables for each die.
](http://youtube.com&t=3391)

00:56:40 [We just had one variable, which happened to be a list and a list can contain multiple things inside,
](http://youtube.com&t=3400)

00:56:48 [and each one of those things happened to be a dye object.
](http://youtube.com&t=3408)

00:56:53 [That dye object had a value and it knows how many sides it has, and each dye can do something.
](http://youtube.com&t=3413)

00:57:05 [By being able to roll itself, by being able to roll it and again when we do the animal classes in a second,
](http://youtube.com&t=3425)

00:57:14 [you'll start to see this take shape a little bit a little bit more.
](http://youtube.com&t=3434)

00:57:19 [Okay. When I first learned object oriented programing, which you're learning here it was, it was really hard.
](http://youtube.com&t=3439)

00:57:31 [It wasn't until I really started teaching it that it started making more sense.
](http://youtube.com&t=3451)

00:57:36 [Takes a while, takes a lot to wrap your head around. OK, let's do.
](http://youtube.com&t=3456)

00:57:40 [Let's do some more. Let's start from the very beginning. There we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=3460)

00:57:45 [Should we do cars or animals? Anybody cars or animals or something else?
](http://youtube.com&t=3465)

00:57:52 [Anyone have any? What about involves animals?
](http://youtube.com&t=3472)

00:57:58 [All right. We'll do animals. All right. So what does crate demo Dash five Pi?
](http://youtube.com&t=3478)

00:58:05 [Animals. OK, here we go. Just like animals, we sing that song.
](http://youtube.com&t=3485)

00:58:11 [I don't know. Just another five. Yeah, Maroon five.
](http://youtube.com&t=3491)

00:58:17 [Thank you, Colin. All right. So let's create. Let's do dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=3497)

00:58:23 [Let's do dogs. Let's create a dog class. We're going to manufacture.
](http://youtube.com&t=3503)

00:58:29 [Digital dogs, digital dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=3509)

00:58:32 [OK, so there is a good name for our class, remember that the first letter of our class name gets capitalized circle rectangle, polygon, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3512)

00:58:42 [All graph, win all capital. Those are classes. And now let's create our constructor function when we create a new dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=3522)

00:58:54 [Right? Define Dunder init. Dunder.
](http://youtube.com&t=3534)

00:59:00 [Self. Okay, so by default, when we construct a new dog, we're just going to do that, but.
](http://youtube.com&t=3540)

00:59:09 [What are some properties that we should have for our dogs?
](http://youtube.com&t=3549)

00:59:16 [I hear list of actually not all software list, but.
](http://youtube.com&t=3556)

00:59:22 [Property properties, list of properties of dogs.

00:59:27 [So tell me what are some things? If we're like manufacturing dogs, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3567)

00:59:35 [What are some things, what are some properties dogs have? What are some properties?
](http://youtube.com&t=3575)

00:59:40 [Dogs have somebody. OK, breed, keep going.
](http://youtube.com&t=3580)

00:59:50 [Gender. Gender and what else keep going.
](http://youtube.com&t=3590)

00:59:54 [Color, color, size. OK, good, small, medium, large, yeah.
](http://youtube.com&t=3594)

01:00:02 [Keep going. What else?
](http://youtube.com&t=3602)

01:00:11 [It's not a trick question, just saying go look name.
](http://youtube.com&t=3611)

01:00:15 [All right, cool. What about wait, wait.
](http://youtube.com&t=3615)

01:00:23 [How about legs? Kyle.
](http://youtube.com&t=3623)

01:00:28 [What else? Watch your ears.
](http://youtube.com&t=3628)

01:00:37 [Yeah, they all have different irritants, but let's let's just for now focus on breed, gender, color, size, name.
](http://youtube.com&t=3637)

01:00:47 [We'll get rid of all this stuff. We'll just focus on these five properties from now.
](http://youtube.com&t=3647)

01:00:52 [All right. List. Of methods.
](http://youtube.com&t=3652)

01:01:01 [That dogs can do so. Tell me some things dogs can do.
](http://youtube.com&t=3661)

01:01:05 [What are some things? That dogs can do. They can bark, they can bark.
](http://youtube.com&t=3665)

01:01:15 [They can run, they can run, they can jump, they can eat, they can jump.
](http://youtube.com&t=3675)

01:01:26 [Then they can go potty right there. Fair list of things that our dogs and our.
](http://youtube.com&t=3686)

01:01:36 [Code that we're going to right here can do. Yeah.
](http://youtube.com&t=3696)

01:01:42 [Yes, Chris. All right. So what we want to do now is we want to when we construct a new dog, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3702)

01:01:49 [We want to be able to give it a breed. A gender.
](http://youtube.com&t=3709)

01:01:57 [A color a size. Name.
](http://youtube.com&t=3717)

01:02:01 [OK. So when we create a new dog in our software code.
](http://youtube.com&t=3721)

01:02:07 [We're going to want to give it a brief gender, color, size and a name.
](http://youtube.com&t=3727)

01:02:13 [Can you? Makes sense so far when we create a new doc, so self.
](http://youtube.com&t=3733)

01:02:22 [Hey, dog, I want your breed to be whatever value we gave you to construct yourself.
](http://youtube.com&t=3742)

01:02:31 [Hey, well, hey, I want your color to be whatever color we told you to be.
](http://youtube.com&t=3751)

01:02:38 [And then I moved the Zoom window here. I want your.
](http://youtube.com&t=3758)

01:02:46 [Sized to be whatever size I told you to be. And I want your name to be whatever name I told you to be.
](http://youtube.com&t=3766)

01:02:54 [OK, so let's cut it off first dog, OK?
](http://youtube.com&t=3774)

01:02:59 [I think his name a reserved word in Python. Maybe so give me.
](http://youtube.com&t=3779)

01:03:03 [Let me credit me in here. Ben to mean.
](http://youtube.com&t=3783)

01:03:10 [Does anyone have a dog that anyone have a dog?
](http://youtube.com&t=3790)

01:03:15 [I have a dog. His name is lucky and he's kind of our team right now.
](http://youtube.com&t=3795)

01:03:19 [All right. So I created a book called Lucky. There it is.
](http://youtube.com&t=3799)

01:03:23 [Lucky the dog and we're going to make lucky a dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=3803)

01:03:27 [And now we need to give our software the breed.
](http://youtube.com&t=3807)

01:03:33 [So the breed is going to be a string, right? The breed is going to be a string.
](http://youtube.com&t=3813)

01:03:37 [So. Lindsay, what kind of dog is lucky?
](http://youtube.com&t=3817)

01:03:43 [Lucky is a black lab slash border collie, black lab slash border.
](http://youtube.com&t=3823)

01:03:53 [Colony. OK, now the next thing is gender.
](http://youtube.com&t=3833)

01:03:56 [What's the gender of the dog, male male and what is the color of your dog lacked?
](http://youtube.com&t=3836)

01:04:06 [OK. What is the size? Is it a large dog? It's a medium.
](http://youtube.com&t=3846)

01:04:11 [All right. Medium. And what is? Oh, it's lucky.
](http://youtube.com&t=3851)

01:04:15 [There it is. Right? All right. So now just by doing this code right here, I've created Lindsay's dog in software, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=3855)

01:04:27 [There it is. I have created Lindsay's dog in software.
](http://youtube.com&t=3867)

01:04:32 [In fact, if I say print out what kind of dog is lucky, I'll say breed just like that, it's going to come back and tell me that Lindsay's dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=3872)

01:04:45 [Is an error, OK, has no attribute name. I knew a new name was going to give me an issue.
](http://youtube.com&t=3885)

01:04:52 [Hold on one second. Lucky dot, lucky dot name.
](http://youtube.com&t=3892)

01:04:59 [OK, hold on. You're Reid. Gender, yes, thank you.
](http://youtube.com&t=3899)

01:05:08 [So that gender. And let's see if that fixes it, Robert.
](http://youtube.com&t=3908)

01:05:19 [Name name has given me. So let me just go right here.
](http://youtube.com&t=3919)

01:05:26 [So don't name names, I think name may be a reserved word.
](http://youtube.com&t=3926)

01:05:33 [Let's just call it. What's another word for name?
](http://youtube.com&t=3933)

01:05:39 [What's another variable for name that I could use, I don't. OK, very formal now.
](http://youtube.com&t=3939)

01:05:46 [OK, so I'm just going to change name to title. Let's see if it works now.
](http://youtube.com&t=3946)

01:05:52 [Go. Sized up, my fault means you didn't switch the name or the title.
](http://youtube.com&t=3952)

01:06:15 [One with code, let's just check my code self read.
](http://youtube.com&t=3975)

01:06:21 [So I have one two three four five one two three four five.
](http://youtube.com&t=3981)

01:06:29 [Right there there's that one two three four five.
](http://youtube.com&t=3989)

01:06:37 [Lucky that breed. It should be working, it's working on mine.
](http://youtube.com&t=3997)

01:06:44 [Yeah. Hold on a second. Let me just run this again.
](http://youtube.com&t=4004)

01:06:53 [Yeah, hold on. What love to see what's going on here?
](http://youtube.com&t=4013)

01:07:09 [Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Signs that oh, look, look, look, see.
](http://youtube.com&t=4029)

01:07:16 [Self thought title self, that title name probably wouldn't work.
](http://youtube.com&t=4036)

01:07:21 [That was my goof ready. So there it is. There is Lindsay's dog and there is it's breed, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4041)

01:07:27 [So in software, we have a variable called Lucki.
](http://youtube.com&t=4047)

01:07:32 [That's an object. And that object knows a whole bunch of things about itself.
](http://youtube.com&t=4052)

01:07:38 [It knows its breed, its gender, its color, its size and its title.
](http://youtube.com&t=4058)

01:07:43 [Right. Just like that. And if I create, I'll create my dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=4063)

01:07:49 [Dr. If a dog is a he's black and white model, actually, he is a English springer spaniel who is barking in the hallway right now.
](http://youtube.com&t=4069)

01:08:05 [English Springer Spaniel. And then he is a male dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=4085)

01:08:15 [He is color, he's black and white and he is thighs medium.
](http://youtube.com&t=4095)

01:08:26 [And his name is Tucker.
](http://youtube.com&t=4106)

01:08:29 [Okay, so I created right from this bunch of code here to objects that happen to be dogs that have one, two, three, four or five properties.
](http://youtube.com&t=4109)

01:08:43 [We have no methods. These dogs can't do anything right now.
](http://youtube.com&t=4123)

01:08:46 [And by the way, if I print out Tucker as they breed right, I can then see that Tucker is an English springer spaniel.
](http://youtube.com&t=4126)

01:08:59 [So I don't know about you, but everything, you know, kind of what we've learned in this class, right,
](http://youtube.com&t=4139)

01:09:06 [this this like totally changes the game because unlike anything else, we are creating a template.
](http://youtube.com&t=4146)

01:09:16 [Kind of like the graphics library, where we're able to define an object, right, which has.
](http://youtube.com&t=4156)

01:09:26 [Instance variables. These are instance variables, by the way, let me just put this here.
](http://youtube.com&t=4166)

01:09:32 [Instance, variables, that means for this instance of lucky and or Tucker, here are these values and each one is different.
](http://youtube.com&t=4172)

01:09:42 [But we made Lindsey's dog and my dog right in the software through this same template.
](http://youtube.com&t=4182)

01:09:49 [Okay. Should we take a break, by the way?
](http://youtube.com&t=4189)

01:09:54 [Should we take a break? 11 plus 11 plus 12 plus 10 is 22, so I'll stop the recorder.
](http://youtube.com&t=4194)

01:10:06 [What's? I'll stop the recorder I wanted to do right.
](http://youtube.com&t=4206)

01:10:12 [So, OK, so data, it's totally a natural thing to find coding difficult.
](http://youtube.com&t=4212)

01:10:20 [OK. That's good to know, because some people will make it look like it's easy.
](http://youtube.com&t=4220)

01:10:28 [And I probably taught maybe two thousand students over nine years, maybe not,
](http://youtube.com&t=4228)

01:10:33 [I don't one hundred and four, ninety five percent of those students, this stuff is very difficult.
](http://youtube.com&t=4233)

01:10:40 [But Joshua just know that a lot of the students that I do keep in touch with.
](http://youtube.com&t=4240)

01:10:47 [I have done really well, and they had this is their first programing course, so it takes time.
](http://youtube.com&t=4247)

01:10:56 [Right? Think about just think about high school, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4256)

01:11:00 [And how many years we're taught like English, write English as a language, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4260)

01:11:05 [It has syntax. It has semantics, just like all this stuff.
](http://youtube.com&t=4265)

01:11:09 [Right. And here we are nine weeks later with a new language.
](http://youtube.com&t=4269)

01:11:13 [And, you know, give yourself some credit for what you know already.
](http://youtube.com&t=4273)

01:11:18 [You may still not be as good as you.
](http://youtube.com&t=4278)

01:11:21 [One day will be at it, but I was I was that same person as Joshua, so and I still have a ton to learn.
](http://youtube.com&t=4281)

01:11:30 [So here we go. So there are two dogs and it says recording yes.
](http://youtube.com&t=4290)

01:11:36 [Does it say recording somewhere? Yup. All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=4296)

01:11:40 [I need to take my glasses off because my eyes lately are just I don't.
](http://youtube.com&t=4300)

01:11:44 [I don't. It's new glasses. I don't know if it's out or I don't know.
](http://youtube.com&t=4304)

01:11:48 [So here we go. We got two dogs. Yay.
](http://youtube.com&t=4308)

01:11:53 [Yay, we got two dogs. And right now, our dogs are kind of boring, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4313)

01:11:58 [All right. One more dog. Let me create one more dog. I'll create Bella.
](http://youtube.com&t=4318)

01:12:05 [She was a dog of ours. She's no longer here. She was an English springer spaniel.
](http://youtube.com&t=4325)

01:12:12 [She was female. Notice how the type.
](http://youtube.com&t=4332)

01:12:17 [You notice how this is changing. See this right here. How it's highlighting what I need to do next.
](http://youtube.com&t=4337)

01:12:23 [She was tricolor. I'll just leave that to three colors.
](http://youtube.com&t=4343)

01:12:29 [She was a medium dog and her name was Bella.
](http://youtube.com&t=4349)

01:12:34 [Bella Luna, beautiful moment. And if I print out, like, print out Bella's value of, I don't know, gender, it's going to print out female, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4354)

01:12:48 [So if I run this code, we got Lindsay's dog, our dog, and we have Bella, who is a female.
](http://youtube.com&t=4368)

01:12:55 [Right? So I have these three objects in my code that have these five properties, but they can't do anything right now.
](http://youtube.com&t=4375)

01:13:05 [Our dogs are unable to do anything. OK.
](http://youtube.com&t=4385)

01:13:09 [And also what I'm going to teach you is that you see how I'm accessing these property names like this breed, breed, gender.
](http://youtube.com&t=4389)

01:13:19 [I'm going to show you a better way to do this because this is but there's just always a better, more professional way to do things.
](http://youtube.com&t=4399)

01:13:29 [But again, think about this.
](http://youtube.com&t=4409)

01:13:32 [This is the first time in this class where we've created a template and we've made stuff just like from the graphics library.
](http://youtube.com&t=4412)

01:13:41 [We've we've we've used that template to craft to create Locky, Tucker and Bella in software.
](http://youtube.com&t=4421)

01:13:50 [OK, so let's go back. We need our dogs to be able to bark, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4430)

01:13:55 [So what we need to do is define, define a new method.
](http://youtube.com&t=4435)

01:14:01 [Right in our class that all dogs can do our template,
](http://youtube.com&t=4441)

01:14:06 [that when we make all dogs and we're going to define a new method, lowercase bark just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=4446)

01:14:13 [And we need to tell that particular dog itself to bark.
](http://youtube.com&t=4453)

01:14:19 [That's why I put self in there. And then I'm going to say print.
](http://youtube.com&t=4459)

01:14:24 [Woof, woof. Just like that, because that's how it Dogwood border, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4464)

01:14:31 [We print out the words. Woof, woof. Right. So I could tell any of my dogs now.
](http://youtube.com&t=4471)

01:14:38 [To Bach. So let's take lucky and say, hey, lucky.
](http://youtube.com&t=4478)

01:14:43 [Bach, just like that. It's a method. We do the parentheses.
](http://youtube.com&t=4483)

01:14:47 [We don't give it. The self here just needs to be here, but we don't put it here.
](http://youtube.com&t=4487)

01:14:53 [And now when I run this. We've seen the same information and then we see Lindsay's dog walking.
](http://youtube.com&t=4493)

01:15:03 [And we could do the same for Tucker. And we could do the same for Bella.
](http://youtube.com&t=4503)

01:15:13 [Right, all these dogs are made from the same template, they can all do the same thing.
](http://youtube.com&t=4513)

01:15:19 [Now wouldn't it be nice? Instead of just Wolf Wolf, we knew which dog was barking, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4519)

01:15:25 [So could I just say, could I just do this? Could I say, I'm going to use that string here because I'm being lazy?
](http://youtube.com&t=4525)

01:15:33 [And could I say, Hey, self, what's your title? Is your name?
](http://youtube.com&t=4533)

01:15:42 [Just like that. And now when I run it, it says Lucky Wolf.
](http://youtube.com&t=4542)

01:15:46 [Wolf Tucker. Wolf Wolf. Bella Luna Wolf with.
](http://youtube.com&t=4546)

01:15:51 [So I'm telling each one of those objects, what's your name?
](http://youtube.com&t=4551)

01:15:55 [What's your title? And then I'm putting out the words with. Or I could just do this.
](http://youtube.com&t=4555)

01:16:02 [Right, Bella Part Tucker barked, Lucky [INAUDIBLE].
](http://youtube.com&t=4562)

01:16:08 [So watch us. Lucky Tucker Park, Bella Luna Park, OK, I guess I was getting ahead of myself, I use the quotation marks.
](http://youtube.com&t=4568)

01:16:21 [What do you mean, Joshua? Like I try to like in the parentheses versus lucky breed?
](http://youtube.com&t=4581)

01:16:31 [I actually got lucky title collar quotation is a comma and then another quotation that says lucky breeds,
](http://youtube.com&t=4591)

01:16:41 [so they print out like lucky is the Black Lab colleague or.
](http://youtube.com&t=4601)

01:16:46 [Well, let's talk about that, right? So here we created our our three dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=4606)

01:16:52 [We gave them a breed, gender, color, size and title.
](http://youtube.com&t=4612)

01:16:57 [Right. And there they are.
](http://youtube.com&t=4617)

01:17:02 [They all have this. Those five properties and all of them can bark, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4622)

01:17:08 [All of them can bark, right? So let's do this again now and let's create.
](http://youtube.com&t=4628)

01:17:14 [We did bark. Let's do run. Let's create another method. Called Run, and we're going to tell you the dog, too.
](http://youtube.com&t=4634)

01:17:24 [And I'm just going to this copy this. What's?
](http://youtube.com&t=4644)

01:17:45 [So I'm just adding additional methods for each of those objects.
](http://youtube.com&t=4665)

01:17:50 [And now I can instead of Barak, I can say, Hey, hey, Tucker.
](http://youtube.com&t=4670)

01:17:56 [Park. Just like that. I meant run.
](http://youtube.com&t=4676)

01:18:06 [Sorry. Hey, Tucker. Run. Just like that again, these are all method bark run.
](http://youtube.com&t=4686)

01:18:15 [They're different things, and you can see here we're getting Tucker to run.
](http://youtube.com&t=4695)

01:18:20 [We're getting Tucker to run if I want to get if I want to get lucky to run her lucky run.
](http://youtube.com&t=4700)

01:18:36 [All three dogs made from the same template, the same class, all have five instance variables, five properties.
](http://youtube.com&t=4716)

01:18:48 [Right now they have two methods. They can bark and they can run and we can do the same thing with each jump and potty.
](http://youtube.com&t=4728)

01:18:59 [So if I say if I create a new method called potty. Kind of put that self in there, and I put in that.
](http://youtube.com&t=4739)

01:19:09 [Is going to stay. Just like that now when I want a particular dog to go potty, I'll say, Hey, Bella, go potty.
](http://youtube.com&t=4749)

01:19:25 [Now. Gerri, what do you think of this stuff?
](http://youtube.com&t=4765)

01:19:35 [It's pretty cool. It's a lot.
](http://youtube.com&t=4775)

01:19:40 [It is a lot, and it's it's the sheer fact that again, we're not creating function functions like do a bunch of code and then they're done.
](http://youtube.com&t=4780)

01:19:51 [Maybe they print something out. Maybe they send something back, but they forget everything they know.
](http://youtube.com&t=4791)

01:19:57 [And when we create objects, these objects live on right from this stuff that we created them with.
](http://youtube.com&t=4797)

01:20:08 [Right? They know their breed. They know all these properties.
](http://youtube.com&t=4808)

01:20:12 [They know they can bark, they know they can run, they know they can go potty.
](http://youtube.com&t=4812)

01:20:18 [And just like we did with the dye, let's say I want to create a pack of dogs, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4818)

01:20:27 [I no longer want to create variables for each of my dogs because that's kind of not a we wouldn't do
](http://youtube.com&t=4827)

01:20:38 [that in in a professional environment because we would have to create variables for each of the dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=4838)

01:20:46 [But what if we want to model what we did with the bag of dice, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4846)

01:20:51 [The bag of dice and create a pack of dogs? Right. So I'm going to copy all this code and not mess this up.
](http://youtube.com&t=4851)

01:20:59 [Copy all that code. Go in, create a new program and paste it in.
](http://youtube.com&t=4859)

01:21:04 [Save it. I'm going to call this demo Dash six that way.
](http://youtube.com&t=4864)

01:21:10 [And instead of creating right, I'm just going to clean all this up instead of creating these variables here.
](http://youtube.com&t=4870)

01:21:17 [Right? What I'm going to do right is I am going to not just do this, I'm going to get rid of it all.
](http://youtube.com&t=4877)

01:21:27 [I'm going to create a list pack of dogs. There they are.
](http://youtube.com&t=4887)

01:21:32 [Pack of dogs. It's an empty list. But my job now is to be able to create like 100.
](http://youtube.com&t=4892)

01:21:41 [Dogs, right? I'm going to make the same dog for now, just for my example.
](http://youtube.com&t=4901)

01:21:46 [And then we're going to have them all go potty at the same time. OK, so how do I do that right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4906)

01:21:52 [For I in range of 100 creating a pack, 100 dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=4912)

01:21:59 [Saying, Hey, pack of dogs, a pen to yourself, a new dog, and the dog is going to be a.
](http://youtube.com&t=4919)

01:22:10 [We're going to do poodles, OK? A poodle. The gender is going to be will make them all male.
](http://youtube.com&t=4930)

01:22:18 [We'll make the color, they're all white.
](http://youtube.com&t=4938)

01:22:21 [Will make the size all small, and we'll just call them instead of a name, we'll just call them a poodle just for now.
](http://youtube.com&t=4941)

01:22:30 [OK, so there is my pack of dogs. I just created.
](http://youtube.com&t=4950)

01:22:35 [Let me run it just to make sure it doesn't throw up. All right, good.
](http://youtube.com&t=4955)

01:22:38 [So in software, I've created a bunch of 100 dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=4958)

01:22:43 [They're living in this pack of dogs. They're all in there. So how do I get them all to go potty, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=4963)

01:22:50 [I don't get them all to go potty. Well, I can say for every lowercase dog or four, I doesn't matter.
](http://youtube.com&t=4970)

01:22:57 [For dog in pack of dogs, for every pack of dogs is a list we can iterate through lists.
](http://youtube.com&t=4977)

01:23:06 [One list element at a time, Jerry. And then we can say, Hey dog, go potty.
](http://youtube.com&t=4986)

01:23:13 [Just like that. So I'm going back, I created 100 dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=4993)

01:23:22 [And now I'm telling all those dogs to go potty. So let's do it.
](http://youtube.com&t=5002)

01:23:30 [Now they are they're all going potty at the same time.
](http://youtube.com&t=5010)

01:23:34 [Just by right, rating 100 of them and sticking each dog in a list and you know what a better name instead of a poodle.
](http://youtube.com&t=5014)

01:23:45 [Let's just call the name of the dog a number.
](http://youtube.com&t=5025)

01:23:49 [So I'm going to take I, which is the iterator zero, one, two, three or four.
](http://youtube.com&t=5029)

01:23:55 [And I'm going to make it into a string and we're going to call our dog a number.
](http://youtube.com&t=5035)

01:24:00 [Your dog zero, your dog one. That's that's your title.
](http://youtube.com&t=5040)

01:24:04 [And now. Please hold a.
](http://youtube.com&t=5044)

01:24:13 [So now you can see each of the dogs, dogs zero is going potty, one five all the way up through.
](http://youtube.com&t=5053)

01:24:23 [Don, ninety nine zero to ninety nine is 100, so now I have a pack of dogs made in software.
](http://youtube.com&t=5063)

01:24:30 [They're all the same, right? We're just being generic now.
](http://youtube.com&t=5070)

01:24:36 [But how about them apples? How about them apples?
](http://youtube.com&t=5076)

01:24:39 [Then think about games. Think about games and how we may create a player class.
](http://youtube.com&t=5079)

01:24:46 [And some of you saw the video that I shared with you all about what we're going to do on Wednesday is create a player class to.
](http://youtube.com&t=5086)

01:24:56 [To to do what kind of work we're doing here, but with gameplay.
](http://youtube.com&t=5096)

01:25:02 [Right. All your games have when you like. I didn't know nothing about games, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5102)

01:25:08 [But you know you, you have maybe a name, you have armor, you have weapons, you have,
](http://youtube.com&t=5108)

01:25:16 [you know how you have all these different things and that's what kind of what we're doing here.
](http://youtube.com&t=5116)

01:25:21 [We're creating the template, the class for each doc or for each player or for each dot.
](http://youtube.com&t=5121)

01:25:29 [Yeah, it lends that question.
](http://youtube.com&t=5129)

01:25:32 [So lately I've been playing in like Sonic Forces, like on my computer, and I just realized something then this like code like,
](http://youtube.com&t=5132)

01:25:43 [how do you think they make different classes for each character's skills?
](http://youtube.com&t=5143)

01:25:48 [Like, how do they do that? So we're going to be doing that on Wednesday.
](http://youtube.com&t=5148)

01:25:54 [So just like because like a Ali, sorry, Ali.
](http://youtube.com&t=5154)

01:25:59 [No, no, no, no. You're cool. My eyes were just bugging me when we think about a list, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5159)

01:26:06 [Your player has a list of skills or a list of weapons or a list of things that it can do.
](http://youtube.com&t=5166)

01:26:13 [And when we when we talk on Wednesday and when we develop a game,
](http://youtube.com&t=5173)

01:26:21 [one of the things that a player is going to have is a list of weapons, a list of skills and things like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5181)

01:26:31 [All right, so. OK. Yeah. Yeah, good question.
](http://youtube.com&t=5191)

01:26:36 [Thanks. Let's do it just right. The out of this like on this play, this kind of looks like a game mechanic from a game I've been playing recently.
](http://youtube.com&t=5196)

01:26:46 [Yeah. Well, the whole point of this is this to show you just that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5206)

01:26:51 [If you can only write simple code like we've written all quarter long before,
](http://youtube.com&t=5211)

01:26:57 [you're going to have the need to do stuff like this, I didn't create variables for each dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=5217)

01:27:04 [They're not there. They are an element in a list or a pack of dogs, and they're all sitting in this list, all next to each other.
](http://youtube.com&t=5224)

01:27:13 [They don't fight, but there they are there.
](http://youtube.com&t=5233)

01:27:17 [If I change this to, you know. 100000 dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=5237)

01:27:23 [Not that I want to have 100000 dogs go potty and print that out all at one time, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5243)

01:27:30 [But there I go. I commit 100000 dogs or if I want like 10 dogs, there they go.
](http://youtube.com&t=5250)

01:27:37 [Right, there they go. Right? There they go, there are the 10 dogs 039 all going potty now.
](http://youtube.com&t=5257)

01:27:47 [The one thing I wanted to tell you kind of going back to what we had before and then we'll probably cut cut this on.
](http://youtube.com&t=5267)

01:27:55 [For today, because this is complex stuff, is I told you that it's not cool to say like dog got gender right or dog scholar.
](http://youtube.com&t=5275)

01:28:09 [It's better to create methods and this is on a quiz.
](http://youtube.com&t=5289)

01:28:15 [These are called getters and setters, accessories and beauty towards right getters and setters, not dogs, not Irish setters.
](http://youtube.com&t=5295)

01:28:27 [But here, let me take this out, getters. Sweaters or accessories mutate towards that's that the computer science name,
](http://youtube.com&t=5307)

01:28:40 [where these getters and setters are going to be a way for us to get the dog's breed.
](http://youtube.com&t=5320)

01:28:51 [But right now, we don't have a really good way of doing that or changing the dog's name, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5331)

01:29:00 [Or something about that dog. We could say Dog, don't breed and change the dog's breed.
](http://youtube.com&t=5340)

01:29:09 [But you don't ever really want to do that. What you want to do is create waves in your code, in your class to gracefully change things.
](http://youtube.com&t=5349)

01:29:22 [You don't want to access these property names directly. It's a really bad habit.
](http://youtube.com&t=5362)

01:29:27 [So let's go in here and say define a new getter called get on the score breed self.
](http://youtube.com&t=5367)

01:29:39 [Return self-taught breed. Now that's kind of weird, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5379)

01:29:45 [We're saying we created a method called Get Breed that we can call and we're saying, Hey, dog, look at yourself.
](http://youtube.com&t=5385)

01:29:53 [What kind of dog are you? And then it's going to say it's going to send back.
](http://youtube.com&t=5393)

01:29:59 [To me, the brief, this is the way that you should get information about your objects.
](http://youtube.com&t=5399)

01:30:10 [So now I can say right, instead of going potty, I can say dog dot.
](http://youtube.com&t=5410)

01:30:17 [Get on the score, breathe just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5417)

01:30:22 [Not not this, not dog, don't.
](http://youtube.com&t=5422)

01:30:27 [Dogs don't do that, don't do that bad. But look at I created a nice, elegant, programmatic way to get me the breed of a dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=5427)

01:30:39 [And now when I run this code? I get an error, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5439)

01:30:44 [So what a team here, it's saying, oh, so it gave me that dog breed, but I didn't do anything with it.
](http://youtube.com&t=5444)

01:30:54 [Could I could I do this? Could I say print out?
](http://youtube.com&t=5454)

01:30:59 [Whatever got returned to me, that was my fault before, could I print it out and could I say, Yeah, they're all tools?
](http://youtube.com&t=5459)

01:31:08 [That's the way that you would do things. And I could do the same thing, create another.
](http://youtube.com&t=5468)

01:31:15 [Get her, get her, get the color.
](http://youtube.com&t=5475)

01:31:20 [Hey, dog, look at yourself. Return to whoever asked you what color you are.
](http://youtube.com&t=5480)

01:31:30 [And. Print out, Hey, dog, get your color.
](http://youtube.com&t=5490)

01:31:36 [Get your. Color just like that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5496)

01:31:40 [Getters and setters, these are accessories, accessories, we're accessing information,
](http://youtube.com&t=5500)

01:31:48 [we're accessing information about an object, about a dog, and we're saying, Hey dog, which a breed?
](http://youtube.com&t=5508)

01:31:55 [Look at yourself. Send back to me what you are and when I run it.
](http://youtube.com&t=5515)

01:32:01 [You can see here. Right, poodle, white, this is the color, and this is the professional way of returning information.
](http://youtube.com&t=5521)

01:32:10 [We never want to do this. That's bad. OK, that's bad.
](http://youtube.com&t=5530)

01:32:15 [That's a bad thing to do. And you saw me do it probably in some of the videos about the dye or the player class or something,
](http://youtube.com&t=5535)

01:32:22 [because I've learned so I've learned since I've made that video that it's better to do things and more pro right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5542)

01:32:30 [Best practice to do things like I'm doing here now. These are all good.
](http://youtube.com&t=5550)

01:32:35 [These are getters. This gets me information about a dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=5555)

01:32:39 [But what if I want to change the dog's name? Let's say we adopt the dog and the dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=5559)

01:32:47 [His name changes. So we need a way to mutate, to change, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5567)

01:32:54 [To set the dog's name. And again.
](http://youtube.com&t=5574)

01:32:59 [This is the way to do it. We define a new method and we call it set getters and setters get ers and setters, not dogs, that will call it title.
](http://youtube.com&t=5579)

01:33:10 [We'll say, hey, self, it's time that you change your name.
](http://youtube.com&t=5590)

01:33:15 [Whatever new name I gave you. But when I changed the dog's name, I need to give it the the new title I need to like say, Hey, your new title is this?
](http://youtube.com&t=5595)

01:33:28 [And then you need to set yourself to it. So let's take.
](http://youtube.com&t=5608)

01:33:33 [Let's take all of the dogs and change their titles and their titles to begin with where the number zero three ninety nine?
](http://youtube.com&t=5613)

01:33:45 [Right? So how can I now go in?
](http://youtube.com&t=5625)

01:33:49 [I'm just going to come of these out for now. How could I go in and say, Hey, dog, hey, hey dog, set your title right?
](http://youtube.com&t=5629)

01:34:00 [There it is. Set. Title. But I need to give you a new right, a new number because we adopted or we adopted, you know, a hundred dogs.
](http://youtube.com&t=5640)

01:34:11 [So I'm going to say, Hey dog, take your, Oh, this is interesting.
](http://youtube.com&t=5651)

01:34:16 [How do I get the dogs? How do I get the dog's current title right now?
](http://youtube.com&t=5656)

01:34:23 [How do I get? Do I have a method where I can get their title?
](http://youtube.com&t=5663)

01:34:27 [Or do I need to create one to get their title? I need to create another method get the title of the dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=5667)

01:34:39 [That's the name and send it back. There we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=5679)

01:34:43 [These are this is the proper way to do things. So I have one dog.
](http://youtube.com&t=5683)

01:34:49 [Class. I construct the dog. I can tell the dog to park.
](http://youtube.com&t=5689)

01:34:55 [I can tell the dog to run. I could tell the dog to go potty if I need to get the dog breed.
](http://youtube.com&t=5695)

01:35:02 [I have a getter or a word access or method to do that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5702)

01:35:09 [I have a way to get the dog's color away, to get the dog's title and a way to set the dog's title.
](http://youtube.com&t=5709)

01:35:16 [And now down here we're saying, Hey, take your current title, your name.
](http://youtube.com&t=5716)

01:35:23 [Let's just do this. So I need to say, Hey, dog, what's your current title?
](http://youtube.com&t=5723)

01:35:30 [And I'm just going to add to that the string.
](http://youtube.com&t=5730)

01:35:36 [Just just give me a second here. Adopted. Just that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5736)

01:35:41 [Just that right there, I'm going to say, Hey, dog,
](http://youtube.com&t=5741)

01:35:45 [set your title to get your current title and add to yourself the word adopted and then go to yourself and that's your new name.
](http://youtube.com&t=5745)

01:35:56 [And then right after I do that, I can say, Hey, dog. Get your title.
](http://youtube.com&t=5756)

01:36:04 [We have a method to get a dog's title. We do right here and I'm going to print it out.
](http://youtube.com&t=5764)

01:36:10 [And now we can see all of our dogs adopted. Hopefully.
](http://youtube.com&t=5770)

01:36:19 [Yeah. All right. See that. Get title not defined.
](http://youtube.com&t=5779)

01:36:23 [See, I make errors. So what I need to do here is say, Hey dog, get your title.
](http://youtube.com&t=5783)

01:36:30 [Hey, don't get your title. And now when I run this, they're all going to be adopted.
](http://youtube.com&t=5790)

01:36:36 [See that all 10 dogs got named, renamed from zero one two three four five.
](http://youtube.com&t=5796)

01:36:42 [They've all been had their names change to their old name zero plus the word adopted.
](http://youtube.com&t=5802)

01:36:54 [Now, I don't know about you, this is some hairy stuff.
](http://youtube.com&t=5814)

01:36:58 [This is, you know, we went from writing simple programs to creating object oriented code, and I'm just trying to leave it all there.
](http://youtube.com&t=5818)

01:37:07 [And don't worry, I'll give you all the code. And it's a little mind boggling and it's a little overwhelming.
](http://youtube.com&t=5827)

01:37:14 [And I'm not going to overwhelm you with another half hour of what we've done today.
](http://youtube.com&t=5834)

01:37:20 [We'll do more of it on Wednesday. So thoughts on classes, I need some feedback.
](http://youtube.com&t=5840)

01:37:26 [I mean, I would appreciate some feedback. I think this is very interesting.
](http://youtube.com&t=5846)

01:37:35 [OK. It is somebody else. Could I do?
](http://youtube.com&t=5855)

01:37:45 [Can I do one more 10 minute example on the cars for today?
](http://youtube.com&t=5865)

01:37:49 [Is that is that OK? Just to help you out a little bit more? That's fine with me.
](http://youtube.com&t=5869)

01:37:54 [I'm good with that. All right. Let's just do that. All right. Sorry for that.
](http://youtube.com&t=5874)

01:37:58 [I have to go get my flu shot. All right, here we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=5878)

01:38:04 [To demo is this Demo six picked up on a demo.
](http://youtube.com&t=5884)

01:38:12 [Seven that fine. All right. All right, here we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=5892)

01:38:17 [Ready. Here we go. We're going to create a class to represent cars and cars ready so class.
](http://youtube.com&t=5897)

01:38:25 [Car, there it is, class car, no parentheses. Now we need to create our constructor.
](http://youtube.com&t=5905)

01:38:33 [Dunder Anek Dunder Self will fill in the rest in a minute.
](http://youtube.com&t=5913)

01:38:40 [We define our main. And now let's get going.
](http://youtube.com&t=5920)

01:38:46 [So when we construct the car, what are some of the things that the properties that cars have?
](http://youtube.com&t=5926)

01:38:54 [Make. Model.
](http://youtube.com&t=5934)

01:39:00 [What else, what? What else other color you're?
](http://youtube.com&t=5940)

01:39:12 [Let's go with that. Just for now. There we go.
](http://youtube.com&t=5952)

01:39:17 [So now we need to take these parameters right, these properties and put them up here.
](http://youtube.com&t=5957)

01:39:24 [Make. Model. Color. Yeah.
](http://youtube.com&t=5964)

01:39:29 [So when we construct the new car, there we go. OK, so let's create a new car.
](http://youtube.com&t=5969)

01:39:34 [Let's just go back to the way we've been doing it. Here we go. Let's create and we have a car.
](http://youtube.com&t=5974)

01:39:41 [Give me a car. Just belt one out. What about us over 2010, can we?
](http://youtube.com&t=5981)

01:39:50 [All right. So let's Korea, is that your car? All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=5990)

01:39:55 [So let's create. Lynn Lindsay's car variable, there it is, Lindsay's car, and we're going to create a new car and we're going to say hi to.
](http://youtube.com&t=5995)

01:40:10 [Camry. What color is it, Lindsey Silver, Silver and what year 2010, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=6010)

01:40:19 [Yeah. All right. So I could create the year as a number right, just like that doesn't have to be a strength, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=6019)

01:40:28 [And. There's Lindsay's car, there's Lindsay's car, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=6028)

01:40:35 [So there it is, right? But I taught you in the last lesson that I need to create some accessories for getters to be able to properly,
](http://youtube.com&t=6035)

01:40:47 [professionally get info about each and every car that we create.
](http://youtube.com&t=6047)

01:40:53 [So could I define a new method, a new accessory or a new getter that says get?
](http://youtube.com&t=6053)

01:40:59 [Underscore make. And I'll say, hey.
](http://youtube.com&t=6059)

01:41:05 [Send back whatever your make is, and could I do the same for model color in the air?
](http://youtube.com&t=6065)

01:41:13 [Let me do this, by the way. This is just like one of the programing assignment problems.
](http://youtube.com&t=6073)

01:41:21 [Although. One more and I'll fix everything.
](http://youtube.com&t=6081)

01:41:30 [So we got we got we got make. We got model and model.
](http://youtube.com&t=6090)

01:41:39 [They turn the model. Give me back the model.
](http://youtube.com&t=6099)

01:41:44 [We got the color. We got the color.
](http://youtube.com&t=6104)

01:41:50 [We got the color, and then we got the year, we got the year.
](http://youtube.com&t=6110)

01:41:55 [So this is cool because now we have things built into our code that can look at any car we present itself and say, Hey, what's your model?
](http://youtube.com&t=6115)

01:42:05 [What's your color? What's your year? And we're not. We're not doing what I showed you earlier.
](http://youtube.com&t=6125)

01:42:11 [We're not doing this. We're not saying, Hey, Lindsay's car. Hey, Lindsay's car in the car?
](http://youtube.com&t=6131)

01:42:19 [We're not saying that anymore. OK, that's that's bad because we want.
](http://youtube.com&t=6139)

01:42:27 [We want to be able to not just say, hey, what property, what, what color are you?
](http://youtube.com&t=6147)

01:42:32 [We want programmatic ways to be told what the color is.
](http://youtube.com&t=6152)

01:42:38 [OK? Just it's it's a little bit more than I want to share with you.
](http://youtube.com&t=6158)

01:42:43 [But this this this works well. It can be really dangerous.
](http://youtube.com&t=6163)

01:42:49 [So what I do now, as I say, Hey, Lindsay's car get.
](http://youtube.com&t=6169)

01:42:55 [Was it color? Is that the one, the color? What did they have before I had color?
](http://youtube.com&t=6175)

01:42:59 [Yeah. So I said, call the method, get color and tell me what color Lindsay's car is.
](http://youtube.com&t=6179)

01:43:05 [And it's silver. Right? And now I can say, print out, Hey, Lindsay's car, get your year.
](http://youtube.com&t=6185)

01:43:15 [What year are you? Get year? And it should say.
](http://youtube.com&t=6195)

01:43:20 [2010. There it is. And now when I create another object, I'll just do another one.
](http://youtube.com&t=6200)

01:43:29 [OK. Gales are.
](http://youtube.com&t=6209)

01:43:35 [Car. Alexis, what is it?
](http://youtube.com&t=6215)

01:43:40 [Model three left the color black, yeah.
](http://youtube.com&t=6220)

01:43:48 [Twenty sixteen. Right. And now I could do the same thing.
](http://youtube.com&t=6228)

01:43:52 [Ford girls car, which is just another object, and I'll do it right here.
](http://youtube.com&t=6232)

01:43:57 [I'll say, hey, what is Gail's? Car color and what is.
](http://youtube.com&t=6237)

01:44:09 [Gail. Car year and.
](http://youtube.com&t=6249)

01:44:17 [Black 2016. So to wrap it up, we create a model, not not car model, but a way in software template.
](http://youtube.com&t=6257)

01:44:29 [Right. A class that describes when we create a new car, what properties it should have.
](http://youtube.com&t=6269)

01:44:36 [And then we create a list of methods right for that particular object car class.
](http://youtube.com&t=6276)

01:44:45 [That can like do things get the model, get the get the mate, get the model, get the color, get the year.
](http://youtube.com&t=6285)

01:44:53 [In fact, we can add a new one that says maybe got a paint job, maybe the car got painted that color.
](http://youtube.com&t=6293)

01:45:05 [Upset caller, this last thing, by the way, and then we'll say, hey, hey, self, say your color to that new color that we're going to tell you to.
](http://youtube.com&t=6305)

01:45:14 [So I need to go here now and say, Hey. That's a new color.
](http://youtube.com&t=6314)

01:45:19 [And now I'm going to change Gail color of her car right after here, I'm going to say, check this out.
](http://youtube.com&t=6319)

01:45:27 [I'm going to say Gail's car. That sent color.
](http://youtube.com&t=6327)

01:45:32 [And we're going to make it purple. All right.
](http://youtube.com&t=6332)

01:45:36 [And then we're going to print out Gail's car color after we change it, we'll just do it down here and you'll see that.
](http://youtube.com&t=6336)

01:45:47 [We're going to be changing our color. It was black, and now it's purple.
](http://youtube.com&t=6347)

01:45:59 [I see all the smoke coming from all over your heads right now because this stuff is.
](http://youtube.com&t=6359)

01:46:05 [But then this is like if you're taking JavaScript, if you're taking HP, we're going to be using this concept over and over and over again.
](http://youtube.com&t=6365)

01:46:15 [A web page is actually an object. If you think about it.
](http://youtube.com&t=6375)

01:46:21 [It's this collection of HTML elements.
](http://youtube.com&t=6381)

01:46:25 [Some of them will have classes. I ds will have content between tags and everything in JavaScript isn't object in on the web page,
](http://youtube.com&t=6385)

01:46:41 [and we'll be using stuff like this to go get information about a paragraph.
](http://youtube.com&t=6401)

01:46:46 [Text about an image, so bear some context for you all the time at the tone is eleven, fifty nine and 17 seconds to.
](http://youtube.com&t=6406)

01:47:01 [Parting thoughts, questions, concerns. And look, and looking at you all.
](http://youtube.com&t=6421)

01:47:18 [That was not a single question in chat today. That does means everybody is toast.
](http://youtube.com&t=6438)

01:47:25 [So I know I know for a fact that kids watch our show.
](http://youtube.com&t=6445)

01:47:29 [I think I'm the only one to ask the question today.
](http://youtube.com&t=6449)

01:47:34 [There's something now, Jack Jerry says crickets.
](http://youtube.com&t=6454)

01:47:38 [Yeah, you know, remote zone. Tough stuff, man. Totally different in a physical classroom, right?
](http://youtube.com&t=6458)

01:47:44 [We'd be eating pizza right now. So tough concept.
](http://youtube.com&t=6464)

01:47:49 [It took me a long time to understand getting back to what Joshua mentioned before,
](http://youtube.com&t=6469)

01:47:56 [and it's very normal for new programmers like yourselves right to do things the way we used to do.
](http://youtube.com&t=6476)

01:48:03 [But once you understand how to represent. Something with.
](http://youtube.com&t=6483)

01:48:11 [Instance variables. With methods, right, getters and setters accesses accessories and mutates.
](http://youtube.com&t=6491)

01:48:21 [It your life as a software person can become you can step up your game a lot.
](http://youtube.com&t=6501)

01:48:27 [So one more thing in the chat, Lindsey gives a smile. OK.
](http://youtube.com&t=6507)

01:48:33 [So on Wednesday, we'll do a little bit more and then we'll I've created a game, a simple game using players that have different weapons,
](http://youtube.com&t=6513)

01:48:45 [and those weapons have different weights like a sword versus a bow versus a hammer.
](http://youtube.com&t=6525)

01:48:52 [They have all different weights.
](http://youtube.com&t=6532)

01:48:54 [So how can we write a game with, I don't know, a thousand players randomly battling one another, pulling out their weapons, having a battle.
](http://youtube.com&t=6534)

01:49:08 [One of them was going to die, and then how do we eventually get down to one player left?
](http://youtube.com&t=6548)

01:49:14 [Sounds like a big while, Luke, to me, sounds like a list of player objects and sounds like some decision logic.
](http://youtube.com&t=6554)

01:49:23 [And it sounds like some fun. So. I'm going to turn off the recorder.
](http://youtube.com&t=6563)

01:49:29 [Oh, by the way, there is a you should see in canvas now and something in Module nine to be able to leave feedback for for me in this course.
](http://youtube.com&t=6569)

01:49:41 [It's something that they do to me every quarter and I must say do to me, but I'm on this.
](http://youtube.com&t=6581)

01:49:48 [I'm on this practice. This thing at school where it's called tenure track, where they teach you how to teach right.
](http://youtube.com&t=6588)

01:49:56 [And that feedback gets seen by it gets seen by me like way after the course is over,
](http://youtube.com&t=6596)

01:50:04 [just so you know, it'll have no reflection on your grade will be, Oh Jerry, give me bad feedback.
](http://youtube.com&t=6604)

01:50:09 [But it's a way to to give the college information about me. The course the good, bad and ugly.
](http://youtube.com&t=6609)

01:50:15 [And a lot of you have done this before and you've done it for other instructors.
](http://youtube.com&t=6615)

01:50:18 [So it's not it's not required, but I highly encourage you to do it so.
](http://youtube.com&t=6618)

01:50:29 [When I loaded into Kansas today. Well, this might be odd, but it said I had a we acquired a weevil here,
](http://youtube.com&t=6629)

01:50:40 [weevil to do on you and then my English teacher, it was required and then I couldn't get out of it.
](http://youtube.com&t=6640)

01:50:48 [Oh, really? Oh, God, my belly button that said do later.
](http://youtube.com&t=6648)

01:50:54 [It did give me that button like so quickly before class with me almost late.
](http://youtube.com&t=6654)

01:51:02 [Oh all right. Well, I'll let. I'll let the people that handle that, I'll let them know.
](http://youtube.com&t=6662)

01:51:09 [But again, it's not required, but it's very, very helpful and I get to go over them.
](http://youtube.com&t=6669)

01:51:16 [They're all anonymous, and I'm really thankful for any type of feedback which you already know.
](http://youtube.com&t=6676)

01:51:22 [So with that, I'm not going to give me any more. I'm going to shut up and have a good day and I'll see on Wednesday.
](http://youtube.com&t=6682)

01:51:29 [You'll also have a good day to you and.
](http://youtube.com&t=6689)
