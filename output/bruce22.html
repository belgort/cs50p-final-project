        <h1>Clickable Recording Transcript</h1>
<p>00:00:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=0'>Now that Gerry is here telling us on Jerry Jones, we hit the record button.
</a></p>
<p>00:00:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5'>So I wanted to do. Yeah, I just wanted to share something totally unrelated to code, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:00:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=10'>But you know, you're all sitting on on on Zoom, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:00:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=13'>And I'm sitting here and you see, you know, me coding, talking, whatever it may be, but I wanted to share with you how blown up my screen is.
</a></p>
<p>00:00:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=25'>Can you see that? Yeah, so that's that's me teaching to you.
</a></p>
<p>00:00:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=32'>But right when you when you see it from your end, kind of here, let's get rid of it.
</a></p>
<p>00:00:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=38'>Come on this. That's what you see. All right.
</a></p>
<p>00:00:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=43'>So I just thought I'd share that because Zoom, right, does a really good job of allowing me to zoom in my screen, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:00:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=52'>And allow you to see, like I said, just the normal view.
</a></p>
<p>00:00:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=57'>So, yeah, and that's that's why you never want to allow me to drive a car, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:01:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=64'>Because I I'm like, I don't know. There used to be a kids cartoon called Mister Mr Magoo.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=72'>I don't know that it remembers that, but he he was a character that drove around and he couldn't see.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=79'>So thankfully, my wife read it. Yeah, I remember this and go, Yeah.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=85'>So yeah, thankfully, my wife and, you know, friends, you know, drive, drive me around.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=92'>All right. So let's get started. Let's get started. We're in.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=96'>We're nearing the end. This is the last module. This is like the last like full module on on something called classes, the finding classes,
</a></p>
<p>00:01:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=107'>which you've already done using the graphics library, but you didn't know much about it other than, Hey, here's I want to.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=114'>I want a graphics window. I want to circle. I want all all these things.
</a></p>
<p>00:01:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=119'>But how can we like develop those types of things on our on our own right?
</a></p>
<p>00:02:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=125'>So that's what this module is all about. This is the last problem set.
</a></p>
<p>00:02:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=129'>This is the last learning guide. Clear. This is the last written quiz.
</a></p>
<p>00:02:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=134'>And next Monday. I don't think we'll have class because it's Thanksgiving week.
</a></p>
<p>00:02:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=140'>There won't be any need on. Some of you wanted to take the Microsoft Python certification.
</a></p>
<p>00:02:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=150'>So there is a schedule and canvas under the Microsoft MTA section, and there's a couple of things in there that's wanted to share with you.
</a></p>
<p>00:02:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=160'>OK? Number one is you need to schedule your exam time with me, either from Monday, December six or Friday, December 10th.
</a></p>
<p>00:02:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=170'>And some of you have done that already, and I appreciate that. I recommend that you take the exam on Monday this way if you don't pass it.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=182'>And I've failed quite a few of these in my time, a fewer.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=188'>So you'll be able to retake it on Friday if you don't pass it.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=192'>All right. Just say it. So we give you two opportunities to take it.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=197'>So here is the information right here. You all should have access to it.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=203'>I want you to schedule your your exam with me and bye bye.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=209'>If you have an inkling to take any of these other Microsoft certification exams,
</a></p>
<p>00:03:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=216'>there is one on C-sharp and I know we have a c sharp programmer in the class here.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=221'>So just note that not only can you take Python, but you can schedule all these others to and I'd be happy to provide them to you.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=229'>Practice them for you in person a class on either Monday, December six or Friday, December 10.
</a></p>
<p>00:03:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=236'>No cost to you. Just just know that these are free.
</a></p>
<p>00:04:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=240'>There is no cost to you. So what you need to do is you need to like, like email me and say, Hey Bruce,
</a></p>
<p>00:04:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=247'>I want to schedule h html on Monday night and I want to schedule a python at one o'clock, you know, just just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:04:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=256'>All right, here's the instructions. It's all right here, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:04:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=262'>And the next thing you want to do is I've some of you may have used this before, but we have access to practice tests.
</a></p>
<p>00:04:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=271'>It's called G Metrics. They're the name of the company that makes it.
</a></p>
<p>00:04:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=275'>So if you go through all these steps here, right,
</a></p>
<p>00:04:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=279'>and you enter this magical code right here and select the Microsoft and then Python or whatever exam you want to study for,
</a></p>
<p>00:04:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=290'>you'll be able to get to practice exams so you can do these practice exams and in practice mode where you get to see the answer after each question.
</a></p>
<p>00:05:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=300'>Or you can go in a full on simulation mode where it's timed right and and stuff like that, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:05:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=308'>So again, I provide you with the resources. Usually everyone who takes us passes it.
</a></p>
<p>00:05:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=315'>Is it 100 percent of the material that I taught? You know, is it 90 percent?
</a></p>
<p>00:05:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=322'>Yeah. Is the other 10 percent of the knowledge that you would need to know in some of these key metrics practice exams?
</a></p>
<p>00:05:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=330'>Heck, yeah. All right. So that's why everyone usually passed it.
</a></p>
<p>00:05:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=334'>And just so, you know, write these things, and I think you all know the story, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:05:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=340'>If you go into. Go back to like the beginning of time here with module zero.
</a></p>
<p>00:05:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=347'>I think I had like information about me and I've taken.
</a></p>
<p>00:05:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=351'>All these various Microsoft certifications over time since I started it, Clark, I mean, I should know all this stuff because I teach a lot of it,
</a></p>
<p>00:06:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=360'>but the ones that I did fail are ones that I don't have much experience with, which is like the Java programing language.
</a></p>
<p>00:06:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=368'>That's the one I that kicked my butt a lot. So I had to learn Java, you know, over two months, and I finally, I finally passed it.
</a></p>
<p>00:06:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=377'>And when you have these things, they also go on your LinkedIn and you know, and you can put them on your portfolio or wherever it may be.
</a></p>
<p>00:06:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=386'>And I've said this before, every day I'll get a job request through LinkedIn for especially Python because it's such an in-demand language right now.
</a></p>
<p>00:06:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=398'>And the other thing too, is LinkedIn has a little certification exam that you can take to prove your skills.
</a></p>
<p>00:06:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=406'>And it was hard. Yeah, I wouldn't go take it right away because you can only take it twice within a six months time and after that, you have to wait.
</a></p>
<p>00:06:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=416'>All right. So that's it on certifications, you know, are they required?
</a></p>
<p>00:07:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=421'>No. Are they helpful? Yes. Are they good to have?
</a></p>
<p>00:07:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=426'>Yeah. All right. Any questions before we get started?
</a></p>
<p>00:07:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=432'>Any, any thing, anyone have any questions that I can answer.
</a></p>
<p>00:07:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=443'>Nothing in the chat. All right. And for those of you who did send me the code words for the announcement that
</a></p>
<p>00:07:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=452'>came out yesterday about watching that video or those videos before class?
</a></p>
<p>00:07:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=458'>Thanks. Thanks for doing that. I think I got for people who replied back, So cool.
</a></p>
<p>00:07:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=463'>And let's get started. If there's no questions, so let's get started and you can all see my screen right?
</a></p>
<p>00:07:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=470'>Just checking, right? Yeah, you can see it. All right. Thanks, Brandon.
</a></p>
<p>00:07:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=475'>So let's start off. Let's start off. Let me just call it the demo.
</a></p>
<p>00:08:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=481'>Demo Dash one dot pi. OK, just like that. And let's.
</a></p>
<p>00:08:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=488'>Pretend, well, let's pretend this is kind of those of you who watch the video, this is kind of what we're going to do.
</a></p>
<p>00:08:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=496'>Let's pretend I keep saying it. Let's create some code where we can model a physical dye, a dye that you use for playing board games,
</a></p>
<p>00:08:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=511'>whether it's a six sided dye or a hundreds thousands sided dye or a, you know, a 20 sided dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:08:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=518'>I don't know what the gamers. I know my son.
</a></p>
<p>00:08:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=522'>My son has this big dye with all. I don't know what game it is. Maybe you can tell me,
</a></p>
<p>00:08:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=527'>but let's say we wanted to create a template where we could create a dye and then maybe we can create 10000 dye and we could roll them.
</a></p>
<p>00:09:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=542'>We could do anything we wanted to do with the dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:09:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=545'>Typically, it's you roll the dye, and that's kind of about it, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:09:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=550'>So how would we go about creating a piece of software?
</a></p>
<p>00:09:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=557'>Something called a class, a class or a template to model a multi-sided DI.
</a></p>
<p>00:09:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=567'>OK, so let's do it. We're going to learn a new keyword in Python.
</a></p>
<p>00:09:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=572'>And the key word is class. Class Class C L a ss all lowercase.
</a></p>
<p>00:09:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=579'>And now you're going. Do you remember with the graphics library when you had like circle, it was uppercase, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:09:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=585'>When you had graph, when it was uppercase, right when you had rectangle or polygon?
</a></p>
<p>00:09:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=591'>Right. They all started with a capital letter. And that's when you define a class A template you or a blueprint.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=600'>Right? You use a capital letter. So let's create a a class name called DI.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=607'>No parentheses. None of that. And just a colon.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=611'>Just like that. OK. Just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=615'>So we're going to create a template, a cookie cutter that we're going to use to to fabricate die.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=625'>This right in software in Python. OK, so here we go.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=630'>I hit enter and it's like, it's like, All right.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=636'>What goes inside of here, what goes inside of our class?
</a></p>
<p>00:10:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=640'>Well, a whole bunch of things, right? A whole bunch of things.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=643'>But when you created a graphics window, when you created a circle and you created a rectangle, a polygon.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=650'>Any of these things? As soon as you created them?
</a></p>
<p>00:10:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=654'>Right. Those are what we call.
</a></p>
<p>00:10:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=658'>We instantiated them, right? We we we fabricated that right.
</a></p>
<p>00:11:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=662'>So with a dye right with a dye?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=666'>Does anyone want to tell me when we say, go to make a dye, make believe we have a factory in Vancouver here and we may die, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=676'>So what are some properties of a dye?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=681'>Anyone want to just belt some out to me?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=684'>What are some things that when I look at it, dye, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=689'>What can you describe some of its properties, right? I have brown hair looks gray, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=694'>I'm five foot nine hundred ninety five pounds.
</a></p>
<p>00:11:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=698'>Those are some properties right about Bruce, right? So what are some properties of a dye?
</a></p>
<p>00:11:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=704'>Anybody. How many sides? It has number of sides, Common says.
</a></p>
<p>00:11:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=709'>I'll I'll take that. So let me just do this.
</a></p>
<p>00:11:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=715'>Uh, properties properties. OK, so the first thing is, no, actually, I'm not going to use my triple two three doing.
</a></p>
<p>00:12:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=726'>Oops. Number of side. I have a plug in that extension that I need to turn off.
</a></p>
<p>00:12:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=733'>Please hold. Please hold. I just turn this on doc.
</a></p>
<p>00:12:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=742'>Pi. Can anyone see Python? Doc stream, yeah, I want to turn this off, although I could disable.
</a></p>
<p>00:12:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=750'>Sorry about that reload. OK, so here we go.
</a></p>
<p>00:12:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=756'>Number of signs. Properties, OK, what else, what else?
</a></p>
<p>00:12:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=763'>Collins, right? Number of sites.
</a></p>
<p>00:12:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=765'>Let's say you go to Fred Meyer and you buy or you go to the bat cave and you buy some dye and they're in a package, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:12:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=774'>What do you see? What do you see when you look at that, that set of dye?
</a></p>
<p>00:12:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=779'>What do you see anybody the same shape? OK, well, we'll leave that for now.
</a></p>
<p>00:13:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=786'>OK, shape, Jojo says. What else? OK, what about the bears?
</a></p>
<p>00:13:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=791'>Usually? OK, so they're packaged in pairs.
</a></p>
<p>00:13:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=794'>But tell me about one day, Joshua. Tell me about one guy. Tell me about one guy when you look at it, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:13:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=801'>If you know, how about six sizes depending on the deal you're looking at?
</a></p>
<p>00:13:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=805'>Yes, that's right. So that's what Colin said. Number of sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:13:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=809'>Let's say you look at the shelf and you see a package of dye, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:13:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=814'>When you look at that package of dye, right, you'll notice that they have a certain number of sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:13:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=820'>But what else do you see? What else do you see? No, that numbers right.
</a></p>
<p>00:13:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=826'>So but those numbers, Gerri correspond to the site or when you look, does each dye, especially when, like when you roll a dye,
</a></p>
<p>00:13:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=837'>how many values kind of dye have like during a game, like when you roll the dice,
</a></p>
<p>00:14:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=843'>do you look at the side of the dye or do you look at the side facing up?
</a></p>
<p>00:14:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=852'>Side face it, when you the side facing off and facing up is labeled a no.
</a></p>
<p>00:14:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=858'>So what would you call that? What would you call that that that?
</a></p>
<p>00:14:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=862'>Would it be the the the value? What do you call like when I rolled of five, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:14:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=869'>If I roll of five, what do you call that? Five? Can we call it value is a technical term for it?
</a></p>
<p>00:14:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=878'>We could call it a value because that's that's what you get. All right.
</a></p>
<p>00:14:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=881'>So we'll call it a value. I'm going to just not use the shape pronounce just because I'll take it a little while.
</a></p>
<p>00:14:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=888'>But is it fair to say that the dye that we need to fabricate has a certain number of sides and it's going to have a value, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:15:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=901'>Whether it's what the value is in the package, when Jerry is looking at it on the shelf,
</a></p>
<p>00:15:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=906'>or it's when Ben is using it to play a game with with his friends, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:15:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=912'>We could also add in here color. Right? The dye has a certain color, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:15:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=918'>Maybe. I don't know. I don't think that's necessary right now. Let's just stick with we make dye that have a certain number of sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:15:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=927'>And when we either package them in, you know,
</a></p>
<p>00:15:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=931'>a box or whatever that there is either a value showing on the dye or when Ben uses them in his game, they they have a value.
</a></p>
<p>00:15:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=942'>So those two things are the same.
</a></p>
<p>00:15:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=944'>So how do we create in the software a dye that has, I don't know, six sides will go with four now and has a default value.
</a></p>
<p>00:15:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=956'>Let's just say we have that single dot when we package our dye in our factory in Vancouver,
</a></p>
<p>00:16:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=962'>all the dye are placed in the packaging the same way, with the number one showing by default.
</a></p>
<p>00:16:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=970'>OK. Let's just go with with that for now. So again, how do we construct this dye in software?
</a></p>
<p>00:16:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=977'>Well, there is something we need to do.
</a></p>
<p>00:16:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=981'>And you remember from last week when we created these functions,
</a></p>
<p>00:16:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=987'>we are going to create a special type of function called a constructor constructor function,
</a></p>
<p>00:16:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=994'>which gets run ran when we create a new dye in our software.
</a></p>
<p>00:16:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1002'>OK. So what we do is we create a special name called Double actually what this is called.
</a></p>
<p>00:16:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1010'>Let me just do this right here. And then just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:16:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1014'>Now this is weird, OK? This is really weird. It's a reserve word in Python, and it it's two underscores the word init,
</a></p>
<p>00:17:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1025'>which stands for initialize and then two more underscores and then a set of parentheses I'll call in.
</a></p>
<p>00:17:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1034'>OK. And we usually say for these double underscore, as we'll say, Dunder Dundar, not Dunder Mifflin Dunder double underscore.
</a></p>
<p>00:17:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1045'>And what this says is when you create, when you construct, when you initialize a new dye, we need to do the following.
</a></p>
<p>00:17:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1055'>OK, so check it out. We put this word in here called self.
</a></p>
<p>00:17:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1060'>And remember, we're dealing with objects. They have the ability to to know things about them, and they can also do things.
</a></p>
<p>00:17:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1070'>So our dye, when we create it, it's going to say, Hey, self.
</a></p>
<p>00:17:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1076'>OK, what's your value? What what's your value and what's your number of sites?
</a></p>
<p>00:18:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1083'>So now we're going to say, Hey, self. What's your value and let's set all of our die to have a default value of one?
</a></p>
<p>00:18:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1092'>OK. Now again, I know some of this is highly, you know, just way out in left field right now, but just stick with me.
</a></p>
<p>00:18:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1101'>So by default, when we create a new die or a new object or a new template, right, which we're doing here or by a class may just fix us up here.
</a></p>
<p>00:18:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1111'>We say we create the class name, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:18:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1117'>I called it die uppercase.
</a></p>
<p>00:18:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1120'>We create our constructor function, constructor function and this get run as soon as we create a new die, which we haven't done yet.
</a></p>
<p>00:18:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1130'>We're just creating the template for what happens when we create a new die, just like we did with a new graph when a new circle, a new rectangle.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1140'>It had a constructor which said, Hey, when when you let me carry on.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1145'>So when we create the die, we're setting itself to have a value one and we're setting the number of sides to six.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1154'>We're going to stick with a six sided die. OK, so believe it or not, believe it or not,
</a></p>
<p>00:19:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1161'>what we've done here is we have created a template to make six sided die that have a default value of one.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1173'>OK, now. Just take that in for a second.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1177'>Okay, take that in, and it'll make a lot more sense as soon as I construct my first day.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1183'>Can I check it? Here we go.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1188'>Here we go. Let's just call it die one variable name.
</a></p>
<p>00:19:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1192'>Die one. Just like you did with Circle, you created Circle one, Circle two or i1 I two, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:19:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1198'>I just call them create a variable called die one. And I said, Hey, die one.
</a></p>
<p>00:20:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1203'>I want you to create a new die. Just like that. Just create a new die, just like we did with graph one and other things.
</a></p>
<p>00:20:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1211'>There is no parameters yet for our die.
</a></p>
<p>00:20:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1215'>We're just if you create a die, just like I did here, we're saying, Hey, hey, hey, class,
</a></p>
<p>00:20:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1221'>create a new die that has a default value of one and six sides and store it in this variable called die one by one.
</a></p>
<p>00:20:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1232'>Now everyone's like, All right, if I print out the type of die one, do you think it's going to be a a string?
</a></p>
<p>00:20:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1241'>Be an integer or c an object on a integer B string C object?
</a></p>
<p>00:20:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1251'>What do you think? Line 13 is going to print out.
</a></p>
<p>00:20:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1256'>Take a there's no wrong guesses here. Somebody take a guess. Object, I mean, string, an integer string or object.
</a></p>
<p>00:21:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1265'>I think in strength. So, Jojo, to your point.
</a></p>
<p>00:21:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1271'>We have won a default value of one.
</a></p>
<p>00:21:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1275'>That's that's that little snake eyes staring at us in on the dye and the dye has six sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:21:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1282'>So could we represent both these bits of information as a string?
</a></p>
<p>00:21:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1288'>Or is it like when we created a circle, the circle had a center point and the circle had a radius,
</a></p>
<p>00:21:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1298'>so which was an object, so integer string or object?
</a></p>
<p>00:21:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1305'>You're going to stick with your answer, Joshua, what do you want to change it? You want to buy a vowel?
</a></p>
<p>00:21:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1317'>Everybody I didn't think about. All right.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1320'>So when we created a circle was a circle, an integer, a string or an object.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1329'>And I just want to know it's an object, right? It's an object, so we're doing the same thing.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1335'>We've created our own object that we made right here, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:22:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1342'>And if I print out, it's tight. It says, in fact, that it is made.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1351'>Of a die, so this believe it or not, this is telling you that this variable die one is an object and in fact it is.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1361'>It is a die. It is a die, which is which is an object.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1365'>It's not a string. It's not an integer, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:22:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1368'>It's an object. Because Jojo, check it out.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1372'>I can then say print die one dot, just like we did with the graphics library.
</a></p>
<p>00:22:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1379'>And look what we get here size and value. So let's just do sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:23:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1385'>And now we're going to print out right sides. Sides is a prop.
</a></p>
<p>00:23:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1392'>Remember when we did like? I'm trying to remember an example where we just used a property like this, but let me just run it so you can see it.
</a></p>
<p>00:23:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1404'>And now it's telling me that that dye that we created has six signs that Dye one has six sides and that dye one has a value its current value looks.
</a></p>
<p>00:23:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1421'>I can't type today. Its value is going to be.
</a></p>
<p>00:23:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1426'>One. Okay, now we've created a model of a die in software, now we've created one die with it for our program to use.
</a></p>
<p>00:23:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1436'>But if we want to create a second, die a second, die here, I'm just going to copy this code, copy this code.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1444'>Put it here and change die one to die to.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1454'>Right, I mean, just put a print here. Die, too.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1459'>And I'll print. A. A print die one.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1469'>So you can see that we've created. Today.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1476'>Although one second, I think they did it. Here it is.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1480'>So we've created die one right here. Let me show me sorry, this is a little theaters die one.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1488'>It's made of a die. It has six sides. The current value is one in the package.
</a></p>
<p>00:24:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1494'>Then we have a die to, which is made for a die, has six sides and has a face value of one.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1504'>So using not really take one. So using this one set of code right here, using this one set of code, I've created two dice.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1517'>Two dice, right? Two dice. Two dice.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1522'>I can go on and on and I can create other die using this, but that's not going to be any fun.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1529'>And when we do things like this, we're having to create variables for each one of those die, which is probably not a good thing.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1540'>You learned a few weeks ago about list and how a list can be like a bag of dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1546'>It can have multiple dice inside of it. All right.
</a></p>
<p>00:25:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1550'>So let's just put this aside for now and let me create another demo that's going to expand on this die a little bit.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1561'>So I'm going to do control and I'm going to paste in the code.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1565'>I'm going to save it. I'm going to call it Demo Dash to.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1570'>Don't. I think. Demo Test two PI.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1575'>And there's my die. There it is. There is my template to make die.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1580'>Now this is all well and good. If we just want to be able to create like one die or, you know, a million die.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1591'>Okay. So what we want to be able to do is to be able to give our guy something that a real die would have.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1604'>And when you're playing a game, what's the one thing you do with a die?
</a></p>
<p>00:26:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1609'>What do you do with it, you? Roll it, you roll it right.
</a></p>
<p>00:26:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1616'>So how do we give our die that we're creating?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1621'>Thanks, Robert. By the way, how do we create a method or a way that our die can do something?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1629'>And in this case, it's how could we make it so we can roll it via software and by rolling it?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1638'>What is the one property of that die that's going to change?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1643'>It's not going to change and morph into having more or less sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:27:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1648'>But what's going to be the one thing that changes when after we roll a die anybody?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1657'>What's going to be under my eyes? Yeah, but what what?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1663'>That but what what property of that guy gets randomized? What what property on line three or four of my code gets randomized?
</a></p>
<p>00:27:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1675'>Which property there? Besides the assures, so when I roll the die, the number of side change or does the value change Jojo?
</a></p>
<p>00:28:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1685'>But I guess like the side that you're meeting. So yeah, the the value, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:28:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1692'>That's the the the number of facing up, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:28:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1695'>So we're playing. Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
</a></p>
<p>00:28:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1699'>So what we want to do is we want to define a new method called roll.
</a></p>
<p>00:28:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1705'>Let's just call it roll, roll roll. And then we're going to say, Hey, self, hey di you, I'm talking to you.
</a></p>
<p>00:28:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1714'>Roll yourself, right? And then I'm going to say, like Jojo said, we need to be able to now generate a random number, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:28:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1727'>Because Ben is playing this game and he's writing a software game and he rolls that AI, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:28:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1733'>So he's going to say, Hey, software guy that we haven't created in this demo yet.
</a></p>
<p>00:28:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1738'>I need you to generate a random number between one and six, because that's the number of sites that you have.
</a></p>
<p>00:29:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1749'>So here I go. Ready. I'm going to say, Hey, self.
</a></p>
<p>00:29:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1755'>I need you to set your value to. Some random number between one and six.
</a></p>
<p>00:29:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1766'>So anyone does anyone realize what functionality we need to bring into our code at this point to help us generate a random number, I hear somebody.
</a></p>
<p>00:29:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1780'>We need to import random. Yes, Ben.
</a></p>
<p>00:29:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1784'>So Ben is like, Hey, Bruce from the random library from random import rand.
</a></p>
<p>00:29:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1793'>Right?
</a></p>
<p>00:29:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1793'>Because Rand gives us and we've used this over and over again and write a set of random integers, random whole numbers inclusively between two things.
</a></p>
<p>00:30:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1803'>So could we not write do this?
</a></p>
<p>00:30:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1806'>Could we say Hey rand and generate a number, generate a number from one to one comma one to the number of sides that this particular guy has?
</a></p>
<p>00:30:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1822'>I didn't order code six because I'm saying, Hey di, look at yourself.
</a></p>
<p>00:30:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1826'>How many sides do you have? How many sides you have?
</a></p>
<p>00:30:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1830'>Look at yourself and the diocese. Oh, I got six.
</a></p>
<p>00:30:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1833'>So what it's going to do now is going to generate a random number between one and six and tell itself that that is its new value.
</a></p>
<p>00:30:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1844'>Just just like that. OK. Just like that. So what I can do in my code now, I'm out, didn't it all the way?
</a></p>
<p>00:30:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1853'>I have my di template and my dye template has two properties, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:30:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1858'>These are properties. Let me label these properties right.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1864'>And this down here is a method, right? Remember the when we took an object in the graphics library and we told it to draw itself, draw is a method.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1877'>Notice the method. Start with lowercase letters, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:31:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1881'>The class name starts with a capital letter, and we're not returning anything.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1889'>We're just saying, Hey, look at yourself, change the value of yourself from one to the number of sides that you have.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1899'>So let's go create our die one again. We're going to say die one equals create a new die, just create a new day.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1906'>And then we're going to say, Hey, die one actually print out, Hey, die one.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1911'>Print out the number of sides. Print out your value.
</a></p>
<p>00:31:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1916'>Print out your value. Tell me what your value is. And by default, that value is one because we haven't told our die to roll itself in code yet.
</a></p>
<p>00:32:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1926'>We just fabricated instantiated a new die.
</a></p>
<p>00:32:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1931'>So here it is, right down here. It's one we have one as the default value showing in our die when we created it.
</a></p>
<p>00:32:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1941'>So now if I say, Hey, die one. Hey, day one, I want you to take yourself and role yourself role as a method role is something that a guy can do.
</a></p>
<p>00:32:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1955'>It's not a prop., it's something that a guy can do.
</a></p>
<p>00:32:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1959'>And now if I just copy this line of code again, if I copy this line of code again,
</a></p>
<p>00:32:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1966'>hey, day one, what is your value after we asked you to roll yourself ready?
</a></p>
<p>00:32:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1972'>Let me run it. Do I did I point out there it is.
</a></p>
<p>00:32:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1977'>So one in one? Let me run it again. One in six.
</a></p>
<p>00:33:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1983'>One in five. One in four. One in six. One in five. One in two.
</a></p>
<p>00:33:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1987'>One and one one. And two one in five one in three six.
</a></p>
<p>00:33:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1991'>So do you see how we were able to create in the software?
</a></p>
<p>00:33:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=1998'>A cookie cutter template to create a day when we created it, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:33:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2004'>This is a code that gets run when we do this line.
</a></p>
<p>00:33:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2008'>12. It gives itself a default value of one and six sides, and then we're asking our dye that we created to roll itself.
</a></p>
<p>00:33:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2023'>And we're setting its value that it knows it is, this is what we call an instance variable.
</a></p>
<p>00:33:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2031'>It kind of in this instance where we created Die One, it knows what value it's set to and that is one in fixed.
</a></p>
<p>00:34:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2041'>OK, but when we roll it, we're changing that value to be some number between one and the number of sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:34:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2052'>That particular dye has. What are you thinking about classes so far?
</a></p>
<p>00:34:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2065'>What what kind of questions are coming to mind kind of abstract?
</a></p>
<p>00:34:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2069'>Is this a very abstract concept? A little bit.
</a></p>
<p>00:34:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2083'>And then like. Well, I. Just because you're putting everything into one like what we were doing before, but now it's all into one group.
</a></p>
<p>00:34:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2093'>A group. So what Robert's referring to is, Bruce, you have these functions here.
</a></p>
<p>00:34:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2098'>Right? One of them has this weird name called Thunder and Thunder, and this other one is a regular one that you kind of recognize.
</a></p>
<p>00:35:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2107'>But they're all grouped together under this.
</a></p>
<p>00:35:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2112'>Class that is known as die. Right?
</a></p>
<p>00:35:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2115'>So, Robert? Yes, to that point.
</a></p>
<p>00:35:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2119'>A class is defined of a bunch of functions because again, going back to the graphics library when you created a new rectangle,
</a></p>
<p>00:35:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2129'>you could set it fill, you could set its outline, you could clone it.
</a></p>
<p>00:35:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2135'>There's a whole bunch of things that a rectangle was able to do,
</a></p>
<p>00:35:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2140'>and what we're doing is we're just mimicking that whole concept we learned with objects and the graphics library.
</a></p>
<p>00:35:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2149'>By creating our own objects that have properties right and are able to do what we need a thing to do and will do way more of these other than to die.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2163'>But Robert, does that help a little bit clarifying what's going on?
</a></p>
<p>00:36:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2167'>Yeah, it makes sense. But then like around like what?
</a></p>
<p>00:36:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2171'>I guess Line 11, would you normally put that in the main two? Yeah.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2175'>So Ben was Ben was on my shoulder and he's like, Bruce, you should really put that code in the main here.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2182'>Let me just do that. Is that better?
</a></p>
<p>00:36:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2189'>And that makes sense now. Yeah. I'm sorry.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2193'>Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. So and on that we were to change the value and the sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2202'>Would we have to create a new class? No.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2205'>So all right. So right now, our class is pretty boring, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:36:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2211'>It only creates six sided die with a default value of one.
</a></p>
<p>00:36:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2215'>Right? Now what if Ben's like, I want a 20 sided die?
</a></p>
<p>00:37:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2220'>OK, ready. Let me run the code. Let me run the code, and the default value is one, and when we roll it, it gets 14.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2231'>Two, 10, 14, C, so by just changing the template.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2239'>Let's say we want the default value now to be. 20.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2243'>Right when you when we manufacture or die and we box them up and we put them all together,
</a></p>
<p>00:37:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2250'>the default face that showing is the number 20 right or twenty two.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2254'>I don't know what the multi-sided dial look like, but now see how the default value of our dye is always 20.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2262'>And it's randomly generating a number between one and 20 when we roll the dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2269'>OK, Joshua are thinking about like, if we create more dye, well, we're going to get what I want by two.
</a></p>
<p>00:37:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2277'>Yeah, we're going to create. We're going to create a bag of dye, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:38:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2282'>So not that this has this is not a bag of dye, it's a bag of coins, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:38:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2289'>So I know you have like these bags where you put your dye in, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:38:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2293'>So how could we like write software that creates this bag of dye and a whole bunch of dye inside of it?
</a></p>
<p>00:38:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2301'>Right? And that's what I'm going to show you next. Before we before we carry on.
</a></p>
<p>00:38:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2306'>All right. So again, let me just go back to one here.
</a></p>
<p>00:38:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2311'>And even if we just make this a one sided dye, you can see here.
</a></p>
<p>00:38:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2317'>Let the default value is always one, right? The default value is always one.
</a></p>
<p>00:38:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2324'>And then when we roll it, it gets a new value between one and the number of sides that are available to that die.
</a></p>
<p>00:38:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2332'>And if I do this just so you can see loss here, I'll say.
</a></p>
<p>00:38:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2338'>Original. Value. And then I'll put here.
</a></p>
<p>00:39:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2349'>After rolled. Now when I run it.
</a></p>
<p>00:39:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2358'>One and then five. One an ABC.
</a></p>
<p>00:39:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2371'>OK, now let me just let me there's a couple more things we need to do here.
</a></p>
<p>00:39:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2379'>This is great. We've created one die. How boring, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:39:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2383'>So the question becomes right, how can we create is anyone?
</a></p>
<p>00:39:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2389'>Can gamers who use die? How many does a game typically have one die?
</a></p>
<p>00:39:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2394'>Or sometimes you have multiple die? That sometimes has multiple die.
</a></p>
<p>00:40:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2400'>All right. So how many die would you have? Well, and one of the games they have, like one of the main guys that we have is like spies.
</a></p>
<p>00:40:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2411'>OK, so let's go with say, Lindsay has been hired by a local company to write a pilot program,
</a></p>
<p>00:40:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2419'>and she needs to be able to simulate a game that has a bag that contains five dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:40:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2428'>And how many sides do those dye have? I'm just curious.
</a></p>
<p>00:40:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2434'>Is excited, 20 excited. Well, like for each star, I would be like six to seven on that side.
</a></p>
<p>00:40:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2447'>OK, let's just go with this that we need to create five die.
</a></p>
<p>00:40:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2454'>And we need to be able to, like, take those die in my hand,
</a></p>
<p>00:40:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2457'>shake my hand and then roll the die out on to the table and I can then read all of their their values.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2467'>Okay, so check this out. Actually, I'm going to go on the Demo three.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2471'>I'm just going to take all this code and copy it into Demo three, just so I don't mess too much stuff up.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2479'>Let me go. Demo three here. Demo three Dog Pie.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2484'>Paste in that code, right? And now I'm going to operate a little bit.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2488'>Okay. So I'm not I'm just going to cut this out for now, and let's create a variable called bag of.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2499'>Dice a bag of dice, bag of dice.
</a></p>
<p>00:41:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2504'>And if you remember in coding, when we want to put multiple things into a single variable, we create an empty list,
</a></p>
<p>00:41:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2516'>an empty list and you saw me do this when we learned about lists, how I could take,
</a></p>
<p>00:42:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2522'>you know, a bunch of circles and put the circles into a list and then draw those circles.
</a></p>
<p>00:42:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2528'>So here is my my empty bag of dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:42:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2532'>There's nothing in here right now. All right. So how can we programmatically in software create a new dye?
</a></p>
<p>00:42:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2541'>And add it and place it into our bag of dice.
</a></p>
<p>00:42:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2546'>OK, so let's do it. How do we do something five times what the programing concept?
</a></p>
<p>00:42:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2553'>You're sick and tired of hearing me say, What do we do when we need to do something five times?
</a></p>
<p>00:42:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2562'>Loop it. Yeah, loop it counted loop for Iron Range of five.
</a></p>
<p>00:42:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2567'>We want to put five dye into our bag, so what we can now do is we can say, Hey, bag of dice, I want you to append to you.
</a></p>
<p>00:43:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2582'>A new die just like that. That's weird. So online, 15, I'm saying, hey, bag of dice,
</a></p>
<p>00:43:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2592'>I want you to append because that's how we glue and place new things into our bag of tie into our list and then instead of a string and integer,
</a></p>
<p>00:43:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2603'>I'm just saying, Hey, create a new dye just like that. Just die open, close parentheses, just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:43:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2613'>And now, if I print out just at the end here, if I say print out what is the length of our bag of dice,
</a></p>
<p>00:43:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2620'>which is going to tell us how many things are in that list, if I run this now, I should have five.
</a></p>
<p>00:43:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2629'>Die in that back. Okay, there they are. I can't I'm only pointing out the length right now.
</a></p>
<p>00:43:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2636'>I haven't even rolled the dice or done anything yet.
</a></p>
<p>00:44:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2641'>But I want to just break this down for you just a little bit easier because I think when we create a new die and we place it into this bad egg,
</a></p>
<p>00:44:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2652'>I'm thinking That's. Well, let me let me let me see if I can explain.
</a></p>
<p>00:44:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2658'>So what I'm going to do here is it's going to say lowercase dye equals dye just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:44:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2663'>OK. There it is. There it is. I created a variable called dye lowercase.
</a></p>
<p>00:44:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2670'>Die, and I said, create a new die and hold on to it as a bat, as a variable called die,
</a></p>
<p>00:44:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2678'>and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Hey, die, roll yourself before we stick you in the back, hey, die, roll yourself.
</a></p>
<p>00:44:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2688'>And then we're just going to add into the bag. That roll die.
</a></p>
<p>00:44:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2695'>OK. So instead of having a bag of dye that just has all the values the same because when I stick a guy in here,
</a></p>
<p>00:45:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2702'>it's going to it's going to roll around, right? It's just it's not going to be one.
</a></p>
<p>00:45:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2707'>So before we stick that guy into the back, we're going to roll it.
</a></p>
<p>00:45:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2712'>We could roll it a thousand times if we wanted to using a loop.
</a></p>
<p>00:45:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2716'>But here's what I'm going to create a dye from the dye class.
</a></p>
<p>00:45:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2725'>Roll the dye. Append the dye into the list just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:45:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2735'>OK, so here's what I printed out the length print out the number of dye objects in the bag just like that.
</a></p>
<p>00:45:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2747'>But now how do I see the value?
</a></p>
<p>00:45:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2754'>Of each guy, how do I see the value of each day?
</a></p>
<p>00:45:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2759'>This variable contains a list of the five die.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2764'>So being what we've learned in this class, could I say for every I'll just call it for every.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2772'>Yeah, we'll call it die in the bag of dice for every.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2779'>Every guy that's in that bag of dice, could I say print out died dot value?
</a></p>
<p>00:46:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2785'>Can I say, Hey, hey, Don, what's your current value? And if I run this right and I'll go back and comment and the second if I run this.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2795'>You can see here now we have five, five five four one five.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2799'>If I create another bag of dye. Five, six, three, six, four, five five.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2807'>We're getting all these different value of as we're manufacturing, you know, bags of dice on our assembly line.
</a></p>
<p>00:46:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2816'>They're they're coming out with all these five dye because that's how many Lindsey said we needed in each bag.
</a></p>
<p>00:47:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2823'>But if we dumped out the dove from each one?
</a></p>
<p>00:47:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2827'>There they are there the the dye coming out differently each time.
</a></p>
<p>00:47:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2834'>And if we needed to create a set of dye that has like a bag of dye or a package that contains 100 dyes, we just change our loop to 100.
</a></p>
<p>00:47:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2848'>And now we get 100 dye of all different rolled values, a bag of dyes or packaged dyes whenever we want to call it.
</a></p>
<p>00:47:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2857'>Just like just like that. So let me let me break this down to iterate.
</a></p>
<p>00:47:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2865'>Loop right through each item and list.
</a></p>
<p>00:47:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2872'>Print out objects, value property.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2880'>So here is our completed beginner way to create.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2888'>A dye that contains six sides by default, the value of that dye is one.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2895'>We created a list, an empty list. Create empty list.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2905'>Loop one 100 times. And there you go.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2909'>We create a new dye. We roll that dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2914'>We then print out the length and then we iterate through the bag of dice one guy at a time and we print out its value.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2926'>How many different variable names did we create?
</a></p>
<p>00:48:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2931'>For the die. None. I mean, one, we only have this bag of dice.
</a></p>
<p>00:48:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2938'>So remember that the purpose of the list is to hold multiple things.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2943'>In this case, the things are not integers, they're not strings, but they're die.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2950'>And the two things that each guy has is a face value.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2955'>And a set number of sides. So this is kind of neat until right until.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2968'>Nathan, our boss says, you know, this is all well and good, we're able to create new dye, but I don't always want six sided die.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2978'>I may want a 20 sided die or a four sided die or a million sided right.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2987'>Okay, so we're going to be looking how to handle these types of things, because right now everything is hardcoded right here.
</a></p>
<p>00:49:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=2998'>It's hard coded. We're saying when you instantiate a new dye, when you create a new dye one, and it's exciting any and all times.
</a></p>
<p>00:50:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3008'>Okay? You hear me say this each class, we don't write a lot of code, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:50:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3022'>But it's these concepts. And if you're going into web development, when we start talking to databases,
</a></p>
<p>00:50:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3028'>you know we're going to use this same type of concept where we connect to a database and then we're going to get a whole bunch of maybe.
</a></p>
<p>00:50:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3038'>You know, social media post back and then we're going to, you know, be able to do things with those social media posts, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:50:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3046'>Get the count, the count of likes that the number of comments, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:50:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3051'>So a post right is an object.
</a></p>
<p>00:50:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3055'>Then it contains information about the number of likes, the number of comments, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:51:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3060'>Whether it has images and we can it, we can do things with that particular, you know, social media post.
</a></p>
<p>00:51:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3067'>But that's what we'll save that for another day. So let's move on now and just step in through here and we're going to copy all this code again.
</a></p>
<p>00:51:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3078'>Copy all this code again. But we are now going to create a code.
</a></p>
<p>00:51:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3086'>That's going to not have a hard coded.
</a></p>
<p>00:51:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3091'>Face value or a hard coded number of sides?
</a></p>
<p>00:51:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3095'>Okay, so how do we do this?
</a></p>
<p>00:51:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3099'>How do we let me just check the time here? 10:53. How do we how do we how do we do this?
</a></p>
<p>00:51:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3109'>So what we do is when we create or instantiate a new dye.
</a></p>
<p>00:51:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3116'>We're going to add some parameters after herself, we're going to say, Hey,
</a></p>
<p>00:52:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3120'>I want you to have a default value of something and I want you to have a certain number of sides because when we create this new dye,
</a></p>
<p>00:52:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3130'>we are going to specify what we want the face value to be and the number of sites.
</a></p>
<p>00:52:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3139'>So what we're going to do here now is we're going to change this from a one to that variable that we're passing in called value.
</a></p>
<p>00:52:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3147'>And we're going to change this to the number of sides you want me to manufacture or instantiate or create that dye with.
</a></p>
<p>00:52:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3157'>So now you see that when we construct a new dye, it's got this self parameter here that always has to be there.
</a></p>
<p>00:52:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3167'>We're not going to do anything, but it's just a thing of the language that says this parameter needs to say,
</a></p>
<p>00:52:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3174'>Hey, self, look at yourself in the mirror. All right, cool. I know who I am.
</a></p>
<p>00:52:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3178'>And then it's going to get a value. And the number of sites?
</a></p>
<p>00:53:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3183'>OK. But when we're creating our die right here on Line 15, we now need to say how many what you want,
</a></p>
<p>00:53:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3192'>the default value to be and all that make it one here.
</a></p>
<p>00:53:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3197'>And how many sides do you want? The die to be will make it 100.
</a></p>
<p>00:53:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3201'>OK. So does anyone see the problem?
</a></p>
<p>00:53:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3206'>It's not a problem where this when we create this new dye work, we're saying that it requires three things stealth value inside.
</a></p>
<p>00:53:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3217'>But you start me. Just add to right here the value and the number of sites.
</a></p>
<p>00:53:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3223'>Now I want you to know that this is implied where we don't we don't specify self here on Line 15.
</a></p>
<p>00:53:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3232'>You don't do that won't work if it's just a weird thing in the language that's going to screw with your mind.
</a></p>
<p>00:54:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3240'>So when I run this now, I'm going to create a dye that's going to have a default value of one and 100 sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:54:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3249'>So check this out. Here we go. We actually I want to cut this number down just so you know, from one hundred to five.
</a></p>
<p>00:54:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3259'>Let's go back to five. I'm going to create a bag of five dye that are going to be default value of one and have 100 sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:54:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3270'>So here I go. There they are five, seventy five, eighty four, eighty two,
</a></p>
<p>00:54:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3277'>eight and seventy six and now when when Nathan says no, we need to make a run now of 100000 sided die.
</a></p>
<p>00:54:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3289'>Cool. There they are. They are there different die coming out?
</a></p>
<p>00:54:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3296'>Why are there six numbers? One is the length that's coming out, right, right here.
</a></p>
<p>00:55:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3304'>Oh, OK. Yeah. So let me get rid of that. So you can see.
</a></p>
<p>00:55:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3309'>So now I'm creating a bag of five dye that are 100000 sides.
</a></p>
<p>00:55:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3314'>And I did not hard code into my into my class anything any hard, hard numbers like one or four or five when I create this dye right here.
</a></p>
<p>00:55:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3332'>I'm passing in. The default value I want it to be and the number of sides I want that die to be.
</a></p>
<p>00:55:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3346'>OK. We're at the end of the quarter, you have to imagine that the content gets a little bit more tricky, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:55:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3356'>And this is, you know, it's not easy stuff to comprehend.
</a></p>
<p>00:56:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3361'>So I think we'll do some, some some more examples instead of die.
</a></p>
<p>00:56:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3366'>Maybe we'll do stuff with cars or animals or players or just about anything, any physical object that exists we can represent as a class.
</a></p>
<p>00:56:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3379'>Okay. Thank.
</a></p>
<p>00:56:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3391'>So again. We didn't create separate Barrack that values for the five type of variables for each die.
</a></p>
<p>00:56:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3400'>We just had one variable, which happened to be a list and a list can contain multiple things inside,
</a></p>
<p>00:56:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3408'>and each one of those things happened to be a dye object.
</a></p>
<p>00:56:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3413'>That dye object had a value and it knows how many sides it has, and each dye can do something.
</a></p>
<p>00:57:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3425'>By being able to roll itself, by being able to roll it and again when we do the animal classes in a second,
</a></p>
<p>00:57:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3434'>you'll start to see this take shape a little bit a little bit more.
</a></p>
<p>00:57:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3439'>Okay. When I first learned object oriented programing, which you're learning here it was, it was really hard.
</a></p>
<p>00:57:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3451'>It wasn't until I really started teaching it that it started making more sense.
</a></p>
<p>00:57:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3456'>Takes a while, takes a lot to wrap your head around. OK, let's do.
</a></p>
<p>00:57:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3460'>Let's do some more. Let's start from the very beginning. There we go.
</a></p>
<p>00:57:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3465'>Should we do cars or animals? Anybody cars or animals or something else?
</a></p>
<p>00:57:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3472'>Anyone have any? What about involves animals?
</a></p>
<p>00:57:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3478'>All right. We'll do animals. All right. So what does crate demo Dash five Pi?
</a></p>
<p>00:58:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3485'>Animals. OK, here we go. Just like animals, we sing that song.
</a></p>
<p>00:58:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3491'>I don't know. Just another five. Yeah, Maroon five.
</a></p>
<p>00:58:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3497'>Thank you, Colin. All right. So let's create. Let's do dogs.
</a></p>
<p>00:58:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3503'>Let's do dogs. Let's create a dog class. We're going to manufacture.
</a></p>
<p>00:58:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3509'>Digital dogs, digital dogs.
</a></p>
<p>00:58:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3512'>OK, so there is a good name for our class, remember that the first letter of our class name gets capitalized circle rectangle, polygon, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:58:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3522'>All graph, win all capital. Those are classes. And now let's create our constructor function when we create a new dog.
</a></p>
<p>00:58:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3534'>Right? Define Dunder init. Dunder.
</a></p>
<p>00:59:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3540'>Self. Okay, so by default, when we construct a new dog, we're just going to do that, but.
</a></p>
<p>00:59:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3549'>What are some properties that we should have for our dogs?
</a></p>
<p>00:59:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3556'>I hear list of actually not all software list, but.
</a></p>
<p>00:59:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3562'>Property properties, list of properties of dogs.
</a></p>
<p>00:59:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3567'>So tell me what are some things? If we're like manufacturing dogs, right?
</a></p>
<p>00:59:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3575'>What are some things, what are some properties dogs have? What are some properties?
</a></p>
<p>00:59:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3580'>Dogs have somebody. OK, breed, keep going.
</a></p>
<p>00:59:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3590'>Gender. Gender and what else keep going.
</a></p>
<p>00:59:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3594'>Color, color, size. OK, good, small, medium, large, yeah.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3602'>Keep going. What else?
</a></p>
<p>01:00:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3611'>It's not a trick question, just saying go look name.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3615'>All right, cool. What about wait, wait.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3623'>How about legs? Kyle.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3628'>What else? Watch your ears.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3637'>Yeah, they all have different irritants, but let's let's just for now focus on breed, gender, color, size, name.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3647'>We'll get rid of all this stuff. We'll just focus on these five properties from now.
</a></p>
<p>01:00:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3652'>All right. List. Of methods.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3661'>That dogs can do so. Tell me some things dogs can do.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3665'>What are some things? That dogs can do. They can bark, they can bark.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3675'>They can run, they can run, they can jump, they can eat, they can jump.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3686'>Then they can go potty right there. Fair list of things that our dogs and our.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3696'>Code that we're going to right here can do. Yeah.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3702'>Yes, Chris. All right. So what we want to do now is we want to when we construct a new dog, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:01:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3709'>We want to be able to give it a breed. A gender.
</a></p>
<p>01:01:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3717'>A color a size. Name.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3721'>OK. So when we create a new dog in our software code.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3727'>We're going to want to give it a brief gender, color, size and a name.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3733'>Can you? Makes sense so far when we create a new doc, so self.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3742'>Hey, dog, I want your breed to be whatever value we gave you to construct yourself.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3751'>Hey, well, hey, I want your color to be whatever color we told you to be.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3758'>And then I moved the Zoom window here. I want your.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3766'>Sized to be whatever size I told you to be. And I want your name to be whatever name I told you to be.
</a></p>
<p>01:02:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3774'>OK, so let's cut it off first dog, OK?
</a></p>
<p>01:02:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3779'>I think his name a reserved word in Python. Maybe so give me.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3783'>Let me credit me in here. Ben to mean.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3790'>Does anyone have a dog that anyone have a dog?
</a></p>
<p>01:03:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3795'>I have a dog. His name is lucky and he's kind of our team right now.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3799'>All right. So I created a book called Lucky. There it is.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3803'>Lucky the dog and we're going to make lucky a dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3807'>And now we need to give our software the breed.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3813'>So the breed is going to be a string, right? The breed is going to be a string.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3817'>So. Lindsay, what kind of dog is lucky?
</a></p>
<p>01:03:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3823'>Lucky is a black lab slash border collie, black lab slash border.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3833'>Colony. OK, now the next thing is gender.
</a></p>
<p>01:03:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3836'>What's the gender of the dog, male male and what is the color of your dog lacked?
</a></p>
<p>01:04:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3846'>OK. What is the size? Is it a large dog? It's a medium.
</a></p>
<p>01:04:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3851'>All right. Medium. And what is? Oh, it's lucky.
</a></p>
<p>01:04:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3855'>There it is. Right? All right. So now just by doing this code right here, I've created Lindsay's dog in software, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:04:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3867'>There it is. I have created Lindsay's dog in software.
</a></p>
<p>01:04:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3872'>In fact, if I say print out what kind of dog is lucky, I'll say breed just like that, it's going to come back and tell me that Lindsay's dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:04:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3885'>Is an error, OK, has no attribute name. I knew a new name was going to give me an issue.
</a></p>
<p>01:04:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3892'>Hold on one second. Lucky dot, lucky dot name.
</a></p>
<p>01:04:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3899'>OK, hold on. You're Reid. Gender, yes, thank you.
</a></p>
<p>01:05:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3908'>So that gender. And let's see if that fixes it, Robert.
</a></p>
<p>01:05:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3919'>Name name has given me. So let me just go right here.
</a></p>
<p>01:05:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3926'>So don't name names, I think name may be a reserved word.
</a></p>
<p>01:05:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3933'>Let's just call it. What's another word for name?
</a></p>
<p>01:05:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3939'>What's another variable for name that I could use, I don't. OK, very formal now.
</a></p>
<p>01:05:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3946'>OK, so I'm just going to change name to title. Let's see if it works now.
</a></p>
<p>01:05:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3952'>Go. Sized up, my fault means you didn't switch the name or the title.
</a></p>
<p>01:06:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3975'>One with code, let's just check my code self read.
</a></p>
<p>01:06:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3981'>So I have one two three four five one two three four five.
</a></p>
<p>01:06:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3989'>Right there there's that one two three four five.
</a></p>
<p>01:06:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=3997'>Lucky that breed. It should be working, it's working on mine.
</a></p>
<p>01:06:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4004'>Yeah. Hold on a second. Let me just run this again.
</a></p>
<p>01:06:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4013'>Yeah, hold on. What love to see what's going on here?
</a></p>
<p>01:07:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4029'>Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Signs that oh, look, look, look, see.
</a></p>
<p>01:07:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4036'>Self thought title self, that title name probably wouldn't work.
</a></p>
<p>01:07:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4041'>That was my goof ready. So there it is. There is Lindsay's dog and there is it's breed, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:07:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4047'>So in software, we have a variable called Lucki.
</a></p>
<p>01:07:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4052'>That's an object. And that object knows a whole bunch of things about itself.
</a></p>
<p>01:07:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4058'>It knows its breed, its gender, its color, its size and its title.
</a></p>
<p>01:07:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4063'>Right. Just like that. And if I create, I'll create my dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:07:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4069'>Dr. If a dog is a he's black and white model, actually, he is a English springer spaniel who is barking in the hallway right now.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4085'>English Springer Spaniel. And then he is a male dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4095'>He is color, he's black and white and he is thighs medium.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4106'>And his name is Tucker.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4109'>Okay, so I created right from this bunch of code here to objects that happen to be dogs that have one, two, three, four or five properties.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4123'>We have no methods. These dogs can't do anything right now.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4126'>And by the way, if I print out Tucker as they breed right, I can then see that Tucker is an English springer spaniel.
</a></p>
<p>01:08:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4139'>So I don't know about you, but everything, you know, kind of what we've learned in this class, right,
</a></p>
<p>01:09:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4146'>this this like totally changes the game because unlike anything else, we are creating a template.
</a></p>
<p>01:09:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4156'>Kind of like the graphics library, where we're able to define an object, right, which has.
</a></p>
<p>01:09:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4166'>Instance variables. These are instance variables, by the way, let me just put this here.
</a></p>
<p>01:09:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4172'>Instance, variables, that means for this instance of lucky and or Tucker, here are these values and each one is different.
</a></p>
<p>01:09:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4182'>But we made Lindsey's dog and my dog right in the software through this same template.
</a></p>
<p>01:09:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4189'>Okay. Should we take a break, by the way?
</a></p>
<p>01:09:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4194'>Should we take a break? 11 plus 11 plus 12 plus 10 is 22, so I'll stop the recorder.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4206'>What's? I'll stop the recorder I wanted to do right.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4212'>So, OK, so data, it's totally a natural thing to find coding difficult.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4220'>OK. That's good to know, because some people will make it look like it's easy.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4228'>And I probably taught maybe two thousand students over nine years, maybe not,
</a></p>
<p>01:10:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4233'>I don't one hundred and four, ninety five percent of those students, this stuff is very difficult.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4240'>But Joshua just know that a lot of the students that I do keep in touch with.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4247'>I have done really well, and they had this is their first programing course, so it takes time.
</a></p>
<p>01:10:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4256'>Right? Think about just think about high school, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:11:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4260'>And how many years we're taught like English, write English as a language, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:11:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4265'>It has syntax. It has semantics, just like all this stuff.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4269'>Right. And here we are nine weeks later with a new language.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4273'>And, you know, give yourself some credit for what you know already.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4278'>You may still not be as good as you.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4281'>One day will be at it, but I was I was that same person as Joshua, so and I still have a ton to learn.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4290'>So here we go. So there are two dogs and it says recording yes.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4296'>Does it say recording somewhere? Yup. All right.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4300'>I need to take my glasses off because my eyes lately are just I don't.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4304'>I don't. It's new glasses. I don't know if it's out or I don't know.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4308'>So here we go. We got two dogs. Yay.
</a></p>
<p>01:11:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4313'>Yay, we got two dogs. And right now, our dogs are kind of boring, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:11:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4318'>All right. One more dog. Let me create one more dog. I'll create Bella.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4325'>She was a dog of ours. She's no longer here. She was an English springer spaniel.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4332'>She was female. Notice how the type.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4337'>You notice how this is changing. See this right here. How it's highlighting what I need to do next.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4343'>She was tricolor. I'll just leave that to three colors.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4349'>She was a medium dog and her name was Bella.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4354'>Bella Luna, beautiful moment. And if I print out, like, print out Bella's value of, I don't know, gender, it's going to print out female, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:12:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4368'>So if I run this code, we got Lindsay's dog, our dog, and we have Bella, who is a female.
</a></p>
<p>01:12:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4375'>Right? So I have these three objects in my code that have these five properties, but they can't do anything right now.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4385'>Our dogs are unable to do anything. OK.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4389'>And also what I'm going to teach you is that you see how I'm accessing these property names like this breed, breed, gender.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4399'>I'm going to show you a better way to do this because this is but there's just always a better, more professional way to do things.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4409'>But again, think about this.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4412'>This is the first time in this class where we've created a template and we've made stuff just like from the graphics library.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4421'>We've we've we've used that template to craft to create Locky, Tucker and Bella in software.
</a></p>
<p>01:13:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4430'>OK, so let's go back. We need our dogs to be able to bark, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:13:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4435'>So what we need to do is define, define a new method.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4441'>Right in our class that all dogs can do our template,
</a></p>
<p>01:14:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4446'>that when we make all dogs and we're going to define a new method, lowercase bark just like that.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4453'>And we need to tell that particular dog itself to bark.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4459'>That's why I put self in there. And then I'm going to say print.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4464'>Woof, woof. Just like that, because that's how it Dogwood border, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:14:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4471'>We print out the words. Woof, woof. Right. So I could tell any of my dogs now.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4478'>To Bach. So let's take lucky and say, hey, lucky.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4483'>Bach, just like that. It's a method. We do the parentheses.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4487'>We don't give it. The self here just needs to be here, but we don't put it here.
</a></p>
<p>01:14:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4493'>And now when I run this. We've seen the same information and then we see Lindsay's dog walking.
</a></p>
<p>01:15:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4503'>And we could do the same for Tucker. And we could do the same for Bella.
</a></p>
<p>01:15:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4513'>Right, all these dogs are made from the same template, they can all do the same thing.
</a></p>
<p>01:15:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4519'>Now wouldn't it be nice? Instead of just Wolf Wolf, we knew which dog was barking, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:15:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4525'>So could I just say, could I just do this? Could I say, I'm going to use that string here because I'm being lazy?
</a></p>
<p>01:15:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4533'>And could I say, Hey, self, what's your title? Is your name?
</a></p>
<p>01:15:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4542'>Just like that. And now when I run it, it says Lucky Wolf.
</a></p>
<p>01:15:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4546'>Wolf Tucker. Wolf Wolf. Bella Luna Wolf with.
</a></p>
<p>01:15:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4551'>So I'm telling each one of those objects, what's your name?
</a></p>
<p>01:15:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4555'>What's your title? And then I'm putting out the words with. Or I could just do this.
</a></p>
<p>01:16:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4562'>Right, Bella Part Tucker barked, Lucky [INAUDIBLE].
</a></p>
<p>01:16:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4568'>So watch us. Lucky Tucker Park, Bella Luna Park, OK, I guess I was getting ahead of myself, I use the quotation marks.
</a></p>
<p>01:16:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4581'>What do you mean, Joshua? Like I try to like in the parentheses versus lucky breed?
</a></p>
<p>01:16:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4591'>I actually got lucky title collar quotation is a comma and then another quotation that says lucky breeds,
</a></p>
<p>01:16:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4601'>so they print out like lucky is the Black Lab colleague or.
</a></p>
<p>01:16:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4606'>Well, let's talk about that, right? So here we created our our three dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:16:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4612'>We gave them a breed, gender, color, size and title.
</a></p>
<p>01:16:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4617'>Right. And there they are.
</a></p>
<p>01:17:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4622'>They all have this. Those five properties and all of them can bark, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:17:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4628'>All of them can bark, right? So let's do this again now and let's create.
</a></p>
<p>01:17:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4634'>We did bark. Let's do run. Let's create another method. Called Run, and we're going to tell you the dog, too.
</a></p>
<p>01:17:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4644'>And I'm just going to this copy this. What's?
</a></p>
<p>01:17:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4665'>So I'm just adding additional methods for each of those objects.
</a></p>
<p>01:17:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4670'>And now I can instead of Barak, I can say, Hey, hey, Tucker.
</a></p>
<p>01:17:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4676'>Park. Just like that. I meant run.
</a></p>
<p>01:18:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4686'>Sorry. Hey, Tucker. Run. Just like that again, these are all method bark run.
</a></p>
<p>01:18:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4695'>They're different things, and you can see here we're getting Tucker to run.
</a></p>
<p>01:18:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4700'>We're getting Tucker to run if I want to get if I want to get lucky to run her lucky run.
</a></p>
<p>01:18:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4716'>All three dogs made from the same template, the same class, all have five instance variables, five properties.
</a></p>
<p>01:18:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4728'>Right now they have two methods. They can bark and they can run and we can do the same thing with each jump and potty.
</a></p>
<p>01:18:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4739'>So if I say if I create a new method called potty. Kind of put that self in there, and I put in that.
</a></p>
<p>01:19:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4749'>Is going to stay. Just like that now when I want a particular dog to go potty, I'll say, Hey, Bella, go potty.
</a></p>
<p>01:19:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4765'>Now. Gerri, what do you think of this stuff?
</a></p>
<p>01:19:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4775'>It's pretty cool. It's a lot.
</a></p>
<p>01:19:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4780'>It is a lot, and it's it's the sheer fact that again, we're not creating function functions like do a bunch of code and then they're done.
</a></p>
<p>01:19:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4791'>Maybe they print something out. Maybe they send something back, but they forget everything they know.
</a></p>
<p>01:19:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4797'>And when we create objects, these objects live on right from this stuff that we created them with.
</a></p>
<p>01:20:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4808'>Right? They know their breed. They know all these properties.
</a></p>
<p>01:20:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4812'>They know they can bark, they know they can run, they know they can go potty.
</a></p>
<p>01:20:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4818'>And just like we did with the dye, let's say I want to create a pack of dogs, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:20:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4827'>I no longer want to create variables for each of my dogs because that's kind of not a we wouldn't do
</a></p>
<p>01:20:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4838'>that in in a professional environment because we would have to create variables for each of the dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:20:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4846'>But what if we want to model what we did with the bag of dice, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:20:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4851'>The bag of dice and create a pack of dogs? Right. So I'm going to copy all this code and not mess this up.
</a></p>
<p>01:20:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4859'>Copy all that code. Go in, create a new program and paste it in.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4864'>Save it. I'm going to call this demo Dash six that way.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4870'>And instead of creating right, I'm just going to clean all this up instead of creating these variables here.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4877'>Right? What I'm going to do right is I am going to not just do this, I'm going to get rid of it all.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4887'>I'm going to create a list pack of dogs. There they are.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4892'>Pack of dogs. It's an empty list. But my job now is to be able to create like 100.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4901'>Dogs, right? I'm going to make the same dog for now, just for my example.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4906'>And then we're going to have them all go potty at the same time. OK, so how do I do that right?
</a></p>
<p>01:21:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4912'>For I in range of 100 creating a pack, 100 dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:21:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4919'>Saying, Hey, pack of dogs, a pen to yourself, a new dog, and the dog is going to be a.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4930'>We're going to do poodles, OK? A poodle. The gender is going to be will make them all male.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4938'>We'll make the color, they're all white.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4941'>Will make the size all small, and we'll just call them instead of a name, we'll just call them a poodle just for now.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4950'>OK, so there is my pack of dogs. I just created.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4955'>Let me run it just to make sure it doesn't throw up. All right, good.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4958'>So in software, I've created a bunch of 100 dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4963'>They're living in this pack of dogs. They're all in there. So how do I get them all to go potty, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:22:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4970'>I don't get them all to go potty. Well, I can say for every lowercase dog or four, I doesn't matter.
</a></p>
<p>01:22:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4977'>For dog in pack of dogs, for every pack of dogs is a list we can iterate through lists.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4986'>One list element at a time, Jerry. And then we can say, Hey dog, go potty.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=4993'>Just like that. So I'm going back, I created 100 dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5002'>And now I'm telling all those dogs to go potty. So let's do it.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5010'>Now they are they're all going potty at the same time.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5014'>Just by right, rating 100 of them and sticking each dog in a list and you know what a better name instead of a poodle.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5025'>Let's just call the name of the dog a number.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5029'>So I'm going to take I, which is the iterator zero, one, two, three or four.
</a></p>
<p>01:23:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5035'>And I'm going to make it into a string and we're going to call our dog a number.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5040'>Your dog zero, your dog one. That's that's your title.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5044'>And now. Please hold a.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5053'>So now you can see each of the dogs, dogs zero is going potty, one five all the way up through.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5063'>Don, ninety nine zero to ninety nine is 100, so now I have a pack of dogs made in software.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5070'>They're all the same, right? We're just being generic now.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5076'>But how about them apples? How about them apples?
</a></p>
<p>01:24:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5079'>Then think about games. Think about games and how we may create a player class.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5086'>And some of you saw the video that I shared with you all about what we're going to do on Wednesday is create a player class to.
</a></p>
<p>01:24:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5096'>To to do what kind of work we're doing here, but with gameplay.
</a></p>
<p>01:25:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5102'>Right. All your games have when you like. I didn't know nothing about games, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:25:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5108'>But you know you, you have maybe a name, you have armor, you have weapons, you have,
</a></p>
<p>01:25:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5116'>you know how you have all these different things and that's what kind of what we're doing here.
</a></p>
<p>01:25:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5121'>We're creating the template, the class for each doc or for each player or for each dot.
</a></p>
<p>01:25:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5129'>Yeah, it lends that question.
</a></p>
<p>01:25:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5132'>So lately I've been playing in like Sonic Forces, like on my computer, and I just realized something then this like code like,
</a></p>
<p>01:25:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5143'>how do you think they make different classes for each character's skills?
</a></p>
<p>01:25:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5148'>Like, how do they do that? So we're going to be doing that on Wednesday.
</a></p>
<p>01:25:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5154'>So just like because like a Ali, sorry, Ali.
</a></p>
<p>01:25:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5159'>No, no, no, no. You're cool. My eyes were just bugging me when we think about a list, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:26:06&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5166'>Your player has a list of skills or a list of weapons or a list of things that it can do.
</a></p>
<p>01:26:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5173'>And when we when we talk on Wednesday and when we develop a game,
</a></p>
<p>01:26:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5181'>one of the things that a player is going to have is a list of weapons, a list of skills and things like that.
</a></p>
<p>01:26:31&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5191'>All right, so. OK. Yeah. Yeah, good question.
</a></p>
<p>01:26:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5196'>Thanks. Let's do it just right. The out of this like on this play, this kind of looks like a game mechanic from a game I've been playing recently.
</a></p>
<p>01:26:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5206'>Yeah. Well, the whole point of this is this to show you just that.
</a></p>
<p>01:26:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5211'>If you can only write simple code like we've written all quarter long before,
</a></p>
<p>01:26:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5217'>you're going to have the need to do stuff like this, I didn't create variables for each dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5224'>They're not there. They are an element in a list or a pack of dogs, and they're all sitting in this list, all next to each other.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5233'>They don't fight, but there they are there.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5237'>If I change this to, you know. 100000 dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5243'>Not that I want to have 100000 dogs go potty and print that out all at one time, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:27:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5250'>But there I go. I commit 100000 dogs or if I want like 10 dogs, there they go.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:37&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5257'>Right, there they go. Right? There they go, there are the 10 dogs 039 all going potty now.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5267'>The one thing I wanted to tell you kind of going back to what we had before and then we'll probably cut cut this on.
</a></p>
<p>01:27:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5275'>For today, because this is complex stuff, is I told you that it's not cool to say like dog got gender right or dog scholar.
</a></p>
<p>01:28:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5289'>It's better to create methods and this is on a quiz.
</a></p>
<p>01:28:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5295'>These are called getters and setters, accessories and beauty towards right getters and setters, not dogs, not Irish setters.
</a></p>
<p>01:28:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5307'>But here, let me take this out, getters. Sweaters or accessories mutate towards that's that the computer science name,
</a></p>
<p>01:28:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5320'>where these getters and setters are going to be a way for us to get the dog's breed.
</a></p>
<p>01:28:51&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5331'>But right now, we don't have a really good way of doing that or changing the dog's name, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:29:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5340'>Or something about that dog. We could say Dog, don't breed and change the dog's breed.
</a></p>
<p>01:29:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5349'>But you don't ever really want to do that. What you want to do is create waves in your code, in your class to gracefully change things.
</a></p>
<p>01:29:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5362'>You don't want to access these property names directly. It's a really bad habit.
</a></p>
<p>01:29:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5367'>So let's go in here and say define a new getter called get on the score breed self.
</a></p>
<p>01:29:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5379'>Return self-taught breed. Now that's kind of weird, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:29:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5385'>We're saying we created a method called Get Breed that we can call and we're saying, Hey, dog, look at yourself.
</a></p>
<p>01:29:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5393'>What kind of dog are you? And then it's going to say it's going to send back.
</a></p>
<p>01:29:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5399'>To me, the brief, this is the way that you should get information about your objects.
</a></p>
<p>01:30:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5410'>So now I can say right, instead of going potty, I can say dog dot.
</a></p>
<p>01:30:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5417'>Get on the score, breathe just like that.
</a></p>
<p>01:30:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5422'>Not not this, not dog, don't.
</a></p>
<p>01:30:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5427'>Dogs don't do that, don't do that bad. But look at I created a nice, elegant, programmatic way to get me the breed of a dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:30:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5439'>And now when I run this code? I get an error, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:30:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5444'>So what a team here, it's saying, oh, so it gave me that dog breed, but I didn't do anything with it.
</a></p>
<p>01:30:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5454'>Could I could I do this? Could I say print out?
</a></p>
<p>01:30:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5459'>Whatever got returned to me, that was my fault before, could I print it out and could I say, Yeah, they're all tools?
</a></p>
<p>01:31:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5468'>That's the way that you would do things. And I could do the same thing, create another.
</a></p>
<p>01:31:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5475'>Get her, get her, get the color.
</a></p>
<p>01:31:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5480'>Hey, dog, look at yourself. Return to whoever asked you what color you are.
</a></p>
<p>01:31:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5490'>And. Print out, Hey, dog, get your color.
</a></p>
<p>01:31:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5496'>Get your. Color just like that.
</a></p>
<p>01:31:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5500'>Getters and setters, these are accessories, accessories, we're accessing information,
</a></p>
<p>01:31:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5508'>we're accessing information about an object, about a dog, and we're saying, Hey dog, which a breed?
</a></p>
<p>01:31:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5515'>Look at yourself. Send back to me what you are and when I run it.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5521'>You can see here. Right, poodle, white, this is the color, and this is the professional way of returning information.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5530'>We never want to do this. That's bad. OK, that's bad.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5535'>That's a bad thing to do. And you saw me do it probably in some of the videos about the dye or the player class or something,
</a></p>
<p>01:32:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5542'>because I've learned so I've learned since I've made that video that it's better to do things and more pro right?
</a></p>
<p>01:32:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5550'>Best practice to do things like I'm doing here now. These are all good.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5555'>These are getters. This gets me information about a dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5559'>But what if I want to change the dog's name? Let's say we adopt the dog and the dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5567'>His name changes. So we need a way to mutate, to change, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:32:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5574'>To set the dog's name. And again.
</a></p>
<p>01:32:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5579'>This is the way to do it. We define a new method and we call it set getters and setters get ers and setters, not dogs, that will call it title.
</a></p>
<p>01:33:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5590'>We'll say, hey, self, it's time that you change your name.
</a></p>
<p>01:33:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5595'>Whatever new name I gave you. But when I changed the dog's name, I need to give it the the new title I need to like say, Hey, your new title is this?
</a></p>
<p>01:33:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5608'>And then you need to set yourself to it. So let's take.
</a></p>
<p>01:33:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5613'>Let's take all of the dogs and change their titles and their titles to begin with where the number zero three ninety nine?
</a></p>
<p>01:33:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5625'>Right? So how can I now go in?
</a></p>
<p>01:33:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5629'>I'm just going to come of these out for now. How could I go in and say, Hey, dog, hey, hey dog, set your title right?
</a></p>
<p>01:34:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5640'>There it is. Set. Title. But I need to give you a new right, a new number because we adopted or we adopted, you know, a hundred dogs.
</a></p>
<p>01:34:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5651'>So I'm going to say, Hey dog, take your, Oh, this is interesting.
</a></p>
<p>01:34:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5656'>How do I get the dogs? How do I get the dog's current title right now?
</a></p>
<p>01:34:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5663'>How do I get? Do I have a method where I can get their title?
</a></p>
<p>01:34:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5667'>Or do I need to create one to get their title? I need to create another method get the title of the dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:34:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5679'>That's the name and send it back. There we go.
</a></p>
<p>01:34:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5683'>These are this is the proper way to do things. So I have one dog.
</a></p>
<p>01:34:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5689'>Class. I construct the dog. I can tell the dog to park.
</a></p>
<p>01:34:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5695'>I can tell the dog to run. I could tell the dog to go potty if I need to get the dog breed.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5702'>I have a getter or a word access or method to do that.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5709'>I have a way to get the dog's color away, to get the dog's title and a way to set the dog's title.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5716'>And now down here we're saying, Hey, take your current title, your name.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5723'>Let's just do this. So I need to say, Hey, dog, what's your current title?
</a></p>
<p>01:35:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5730'>And I'm just going to add to that the string.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5736'>Just just give me a second here. Adopted. Just that.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5741'>Just that right there, I'm going to say, Hey, dog,
</a></p>
<p>01:35:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5745'>set your title to get your current title and add to yourself the word adopted and then go to yourself and that's your new name.
</a></p>
<p>01:35:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5756'>And then right after I do that, I can say, Hey, dog. Get your title.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5764'>We have a method to get a dog's title. We do right here and I'm going to print it out.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5770'>And now we can see all of our dogs adopted. Hopefully.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5779'>Yeah. All right. See that. Get title not defined.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5783'>See, I make errors. So what I need to do here is say, Hey dog, get your title.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5790'>Hey, don't get your title. And now when I run this, they're all going to be adopted.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5796'>See that all 10 dogs got named, renamed from zero one two three four five.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:42&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5802'>They've all been had their names change to their old name zero plus the word adopted.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5814'>Now, I don't know about you, this is some hairy stuff.
</a></p>
<p>01:36:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5818'>This is, you know, we went from writing simple programs to creating object oriented code, and I'm just trying to leave it all there.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:07&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5827'>And don't worry, I'll give you all the code. And it's a little mind boggling and it's a little overwhelming.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5834'>And I'm not going to overwhelm you with another half hour of what we've done today.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5840'>We'll do more of it on Wednesday. So thoughts on classes, I need some feedback.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:26&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5846'>I mean, I would appreciate some feedback. I think this is very interesting.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5855'>OK. It is somebody else. Could I do?
</a></p>
<p>01:37:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5865'>Can I do one more 10 minute example on the cars for today?
</a></p>
<p>01:37:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5869'>Is that is that OK? Just to help you out a little bit more? That's fine with me.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5874'>I'm good with that. All right. Let's just do that. All right. Sorry for that.
</a></p>
<p>01:37:58&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5878'>I have to go get my flu shot. All right, here we go.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5884'>To demo is this Demo six picked up on a demo.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5892'>Seven that fine. All right. All right, here we go.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5897'>Ready. Here we go. We're going to create a class to represent cars and cars ready so class.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5905'>Car, there it is, class car, no parentheses. Now we need to create our constructor.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5913'>Dunder Anek Dunder Self will fill in the rest in a minute.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5920'>We define our main. And now let's get going.
</a></p>
<p>01:38:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5926'>So when we construct the car, what are some of the things that the properties that cars have?
</a></p>
<p>01:38:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5934'>Make. Model.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:00&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5940'>What else, what? What else other color you're?
</a></p>
<p>01:39:12&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5952'>Let's go with that. Just for now. There we go.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5957'>So now we need to take these parameters right, these properties and put them up here.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:24&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5964'>Make. Model. Color. Yeah.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5969'>So when we construct the new car, there we go. OK, so let's create a new car.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5974'>Let's just go back to the way we've been doing it. Here we go. Let's create and we have a car.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5981'>Give me a car. Just belt one out. What about us over 2010, can we?
</a></p>
<p>01:39:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5990'>All right. So let's Korea, is that your car? All right.
</a></p>
<p>01:39:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=5995'>So let's create. Lynn Lindsay's car variable, there it is, Lindsay's car, and we're going to create a new car and we're going to say hi to.
</a></p>
<p>01:40:10&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6010'>Camry. What color is it, Lindsey Silver, Silver and what year 2010, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:40:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6019'>Yeah. All right. So I could create the year as a number right, just like that doesn't have to be a strength, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:40:28&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6028'>And. There's Lindsay's car, there's Lindsay's car, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:40:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6035'>So there it is, right? But I taught you in the last lesson that I need to create some accessories for getters to be able to properly,
</a></p>
<p>01:40:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6047'>professionally get info about each and every car that we create.
</a></p>
<p>01:40:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6053'>So could I define a new method, a new accessory or a new getter that says get?
</a></p>
<p>01:40:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6059'>Underscore make. And I'll say, hey.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6065'>Send back whatever your make is, and could I do the same for model color in the air?
</a></p>
<p>01:41:13&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6073'>Let me do this, by the way. This is just like one of the programing assignment problems.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6081'>Although. One more and I'll fix everything.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:30&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6090'>So we got we got we got make. We got model and model.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:39&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6099'>They turn the model. Give me back the model.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6104'>We got the color. We got the color.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:50&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6110'>We got the color, and then we got the year, we got the year.
</a></p>
<p>01:41:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6115'>So this is cool because now we have things built into our code that can look at any car we present itself and say, Hey, what's your model?
</a></p>
<p>01:42:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6125'>What's your color? What's your year? And we're not. We're not doing what I showed you earlier.
</a></p>
<p>01:42:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6131'>We're not doing this. We're not saying, Hey, Lindsay's car. Hey, Lindsay's car in the car?
</a></p>
<p>01:42:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6139'>We're not saying that anymore. OK, that's that's bad because we want.
</a></p>
<p>01:42:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6147'>We want to be able to not just say, hey, what property, what, what color are you?
</a></p>
<p>01:42:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6152'>We want programmatic ways to be told what the color is.
</a></p>
<p>01:42:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6158'>OK? Just it's it's a little bit more than I want to share with you.
</a></p>
<p>01:42:43&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6163'>But this this this works well. It can be really dangerous.
</a></p>
<p>01:42:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6169'>So what I do now, as I say, Hey, Lindsay's car get.
</a></p>
<p>01:42:55&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6175'>Was it color? Is that the one, the color? What did they have before I had color?
</a></p>
<p>01:42:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6179'>Yeah. So I said, call the method, get color and tell me what color Lindsay's car is.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6185'>And it's silver. Right? And now I can say, print out, Hey, Lindsay's car, get your year.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6195'>What year are you? Get year? And it should say.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:20&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6200'>2010. There it is. And now when I create another object, I'll just do another one.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6209'>OK. Gales are.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:35&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6215'>Car. Alexis, what is it?
</a></p>
<p>01:43:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6220'>Model three left the color black, yeah.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6228'>Twenty sixteen. Right. And now I could do the same thing.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6232'>Ford girls car, which is just another object, and I'll do it right here.
</a></p>
<p>01:43:57&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6237'>I'll say, hey, what is Gail's? Car color and what is.
</a></p>
<p>01:44:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6249'>Gail. Car year and.
</a></p>
<p>01:44:17&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6257'>Black 2016. So to wrap it up, we create a model, not not car model, but a way in software template.
</a></p>
<p>01:44:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6269'>Right. A class that describes when we create a new car, what properties it should have.
</a></p>
<p>01:44:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6276'>And then we create a list of methods right for that particular object car class.
</a></p>
<p>01:44:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6285'>That can like do things get the model, get the get the mate, get the model, get the color, get the year.
</a></p>
<p>01:44:53&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6293'>In fact, we can add a new one that says maybe got a paint job, maybe the car got painted that color.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6305'>Upset caller, this last thing, by the way, and then we'll say, hey, hey, self, say your color to that new color that we're going to tell you to.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6314'>So I need to go here now and say, Hey. That's a new color.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:19&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6319'>And now I'm going to change Gail color of her car right after here, I'm going to say, check this out.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6327'>I'm going to say Gail's car. That sent color.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:32&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6332'>And we're going to make it purple. All right.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:36&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6336'>And then we're going to print out Gail's car color after we change it, we'll just do it down here and you'll see that.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:47&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6347'>We're going to be changing our color. It was black, and now it's purple.
</a></p>
<p>01:45:59&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6359'>I see all the smoke coming from all over your heads right now because this stuff is.
</a></p>
<p>01:46:05&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6365'>But then this is like if you're taking JavaScript, if you're taking HP, we're going to be using this concept over and over and over again.
</a></p>
<p>01:46:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6375'>A web page is actually an object. If you think about it.
</a></p>
<p>01:46:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6381'>It's this collection of HTML elements.
</a></p>
<p>01:46:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6385'>Some of them will have classes. I ds will have content between tags and everything in JavaScript isn't object in on the web page,
</a></p>
<p>01:46:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6401'>and we'll be using stuff like this to go get information about a paragraph.
</a></p>
<p>01:46:46&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6406'>Text about an image, so bear some context for you all the time at the tone is eleven, fifty nine and 17 seconds to.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:01&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6421'>Parting thoughts, questions, concerns. And look, and looking at you all.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6438'>That was not a single question in chat today. That does means everybody is toast.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:25&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6445'>So I know I know for a fact that kids watch our show.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6449'>I think I'm the only one to ask the question today.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:34&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6454'>There's something now, Jack Jerry says crickets.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:38&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6458'>Yeah, you know, remote zone. Tough stuff, man. Totally different in a physical classroom, right?
</a></p>
<p>01:47:44&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6464'>We'd be eating pizza right now. So tough concept.
</a></p>
<p>01:47:49&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6469'>It took me a long time to understand getting back to what Joshua mentioned before,
</a></p>
<p>01:47:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6476'>and it's very normal for new programmers like yourselves right to do things the way we used to do.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:03&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6483'>But once you understand how to represent. Something with.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:11&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6491'>Instance variables. With methods, right, getters and setters accesses accessories and mutates.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:21&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6501'>It your life as a software person can become you can step up your game a lot.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:27&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6507'>So one more thing in the chat, Lindsey gives a smile. OK.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:33&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6513'>So on Wednesday, we'll do a little bit more and then we'll I've created a game, a simple game using players that have different weapons,
</a></p>
<p>01:48:45&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6525'>and those weapons have different weights like a sword versus a bow versus a hammer.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:52&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6532'>They have all different weights.
</a></p>
<p>01:48:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6534'>So how can we write a game with, I don't know, a thousand players randomly battling one another, pulling out their weapons, having a battle.
</a></p>
<p>01:49:08&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6548'>One of them was going to die, and then how do we eventually get down to one player left?
</a></p>
<p>01:49:14&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6554'>Sounds like a big while, Luke, to me, sounds like a list of player objects and sounds like some decision logic.
</a></p>
<p>01:49:23&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6563'>And it sounds like some fun. So. I'm going to turn off the recorder.
</a></p>
<p>01:49:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6569'>Oh, by the way, there is a you should see in canvas now and something in Module nine to be able to leave feedback for for me in this course.
</a></p>
<p>01:49:41&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6581'>It's something that they do to me every quarter and I must say do to me, but I'm on this.
</a></p>
<p>01:49:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6588'>I'm on this practice. This thing at school where it's called tenure track, where they teach you how to teach right.
</a></p>
<p>01:49:56&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6596'>And that feedback gets seen by it gets seen by me like way after the course is over,
</a></p>
<p>01:50:04&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6604'>just so you know, it'll have no reflection on your grade will be, Oh Jerry, give me bad feedback.
</a></p>
<p>01:50:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6609'>But it's a way to to give the college information about me. The course the good, bad and ugly.
</a></p>
<p>01:50:15&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6615'>And a lot of you have done this before and you've done it for other instructors.
</a></p>
<p>01:50:18&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6618'>So it's not it's not required, but I highly encourage you to do it so.
</a></p>
<p>01:50:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6629'>When I loaded into Kansas today. Well, this might be odd, but it said I had a we acquired a weevil here,
</a></p>
<p>01:50:40&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6640'>weevil to do on you and then my English teacher, it was required and then I couldn't get out of it.
</a></p>
<p>01:50:48&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6648'>Oh, really? Oh, God, my belly button that said do later.
</a></p>
<p>01:50:54&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6654'>It did give me that button like so quickly before class with me almost late.
</a></p>
<p>01:51:02&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6662'>Oh all right. Well, I'll let. I'll let the people that handle that, I'll let them know.
</a></p>
<p>01:51:09&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6669'>But again, it's not required, but it's very, very helpful and I get to go over them.
</a></p>
<p>01:51:16&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6676'>They're all anonymous, and I'm really thankful for any type of feedback which you already know.
</a></p>
<p>01:51:22&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6682'>So with that, I'm not going to give me any more. I'm going to shut up and have a good day and I'll see on Wednesday.
</a></p>
<p>01:51:29&nbsp;<a href='http://yo.com&t=6689'>You'll also have a good day to you and.
</a></p>
